**Message From Our CEO**

We are living in a historic time. The era of AI has arrived—and with it, a new industrial revolution. The shift from general-purpose computing to AI is transforming every industry, every scientific field, and daily life.

AI is more than a technological shift—it’s the birth of an entirely new manufacturing industry, bringing profound economic and societal opportunities. Today’s data centers, built for general-purpose computing, don’t have the performance or efficiency to support AI. Modernizing more than $1 trillion of data centers is now underway.

At the center of this transformation is the AI factory—where electricity goes in and tokens come out. Data is transformed into intelligence, and intelligence drives the new economy.

Traditional manufacturing runs on 100-megawatt factories. But this new industry—AI manufacturing—is something else entirely. Each one is a $60 billion investment. It takes three years to build and requires a vast new workforce.

We’ll need carpenters, steelworkers, masons, mechanical and electrical engineers, and plumbers—the tradecraft that will power this new economy. Then come the experts in computing, networking, and operations.

At the next layer, AI agents will transform knowledge work—assisting doctors, financial service professionals, and customer care teams. At NVIDIA, every software engineer is now assisted by AI. The amount of code we produce is extraordinary. Our productivity has increased dramatically—alongside our ability to invest in new ideas and invent more of what the world needs.

**Energy Is the Limiter**

Electricity is the lifeblood of digital intelligence. We need more.

We must build AI factories for this industry to thrive. However, supplying them with the electricity they will need isn’t sustainable with today’s energy infrastructure.

The solution is twofold. First, we need a national, industry-focused energy policy supporting this new industry’s growth. A single AI factory can draw 100 to 200 megawatts—on par with the world’s largest data centers.

These systems are being built continuously across industries and nations. We appreciate the current administration’s leadership here and will contribute however we can.

But in an economy where electricity creates intelligence—and intelligence drives revenue—removing the energy bottleneck isn’t enough.

We must design AI factories where extreme performance and energy efficiency aren’t a tradeoff.

**A New Computing Platform for a New Era**

We began building toward this future over a decade ago, reinventing the entire computing stack—from GPU architecture and system design to libraries, developer tools, and software platforms tailored for specific industries. Today, NVIDIA is a full-stack AI company, with more than 6 million developers building AI applications that discover life-saving drugs, design climate models, and optimize global supply chains.

Our Blackwell architecture marked a breakthrough moment in computing. In its first quarter, Blackwell became the fastest-

<footer>NVIDIA Sustainability | Message From Our CEO</footer>

<page_number>03</page_number>ramping product in our history. It is the engine of the AI factory—and the solution to the data center energy bottlenecks.

Our Blackwell platform delivers a 25x improvement in energy efficiency for LLM inference compared to the Hopper generation. It’s not just faster—it’s fundamentally more efficient.

Accelerated computing is 20x more energy efficient than traditional computing across a mix of AI workloads. With revolutionary density, a liquid-cooled rack now holds a 1 exaflop system powered by 600,000 components working as one. Blackwell’s performance-per-watt and density unlock intelligence production at industrial scale.

NVIDIA is investing in U.S. manufacturing, building AI supercomputers for the first time in the U.S. Working with TSMC, Foxconn, Wistron, Amkor, and SPIL, NVIDIA plans to produce up to $500 billion worth of AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years—strengthening supply chain resilience and creating hundreds of thousands of American jobs.

With this AI infrastructure in place, we’ll help revolutionize every other industry, and ultimately create new ones we’ve yet to imagine.

## Transforming Healthcare and Life Sciences with AI

AI is transforming healthcare—from diagnosis to precision treatment—and helping accelerate the discovery of life-saving drugs.

Our AI platforms are driving breakthroughs in precision drug discovery with partners like Genentech and Amgen, and powering intelligent surgical platforms with Johnson & Johnson MedTech.

We’ve partnered with governments, healthcare providers, academic institutions, and startups to accelerate genomics, disease prediction, and patient care:

> BrainStorm Therapeutics uses NVIDIA BioNeMo AI models and patient-derived brain cell models to accelerate the repurposing of drugs for neurological diseases. The team identified Donepezil, an Alzheimer’s drug, as a potential therapy for Rett syndrome—applying for an FDA-cleared Phase 2 trial in just nine months, compared to years traditionally.

> Evo 2, a next-generation biomolecular AI model trained on nearly 9 trillion nucleotides, predicts protein function, identifies potential treatments, and evaluates gene mutations—accelerating progress in drug discovery, biofuels, and environmental cleanup.

We are building technology to save lives.

## Expanding Access to AI Education and Skills

We are investing deeply to ensure AI opportunities are accessible to everyone.

> California launched a first-of-its-kind AI education initiative with NVIDIA to train students and educators statewide, preparing thousands for AI careers and driving economic development. Through the Deep Learning Institute, NVIDIA will provide teaching kits, cloud GPU access, and workforce certification. Projects include using Omniverse to build digital twins for San José and training students on underwater data center technology.

> NVIDIA and the State of Oregon announced a new collaboration to build an AI-ready workforce, anchored by a $10 million investment. Oregon will gain access to NVIDIA technologies and training programs to upskill workers, foster innovation, and drive economic growth across key industries statewide.

> The State of Utah launched a new AI education initiative with NVIDIA to prepare students and professionals for careers in AI. Beginning with eight top universities, educators across Utah’s universities and colleges will gain certification and access to cloud GPU resources, helping build a competitive, tech-savvy workforce for the future.

> NVIDIA and partners launched Signs, an AI-powered platform to bridge communication gaps between the deaf and hearing communities. Users can practice signing with the help of a 3D avatar and receive real-time AI feedback through webcam analysis. The project aims to build a validated dataset of 400,000 video clips covering 1,000 signed words to support ASL education and accessible AI technologies.

## Building Smarter, Safer Infrastructure

The future demands infrastructure that is smarter, faster, safer, and more sustainable.

> AI2’s EarthRanger platform, trained with NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, supports conservation efforts across 76 countries and 650 protected areas. EarthRanger aggregates real-time data from satellites, sensors, and field reports to help rangers monitor wildlife, prevent poaching, and protect ecosystems—creating the world’s largest database for elephant movement prediction and wildlife management.

### Our Commitment to Sustainability

Through all of this, we are focused on our sustainability efforts. This year, our team achieved a major milestone: 100% of NVIDIA’s global electricity consumption is powered by or matched with renewable energy.

We are working to reduce emissions wherever we can. For the first time, we published a product carbon footprint summary for a GPU-accelerated server. We found that manufacturing-related emissions are significantly lower than previously estimated—a testament to the power of AI to optimize products, processes, and supply chains. AI is already making a major contribution to global sustainability efforts.

### Culture, Community, and Responsibility

Helping our communities has always been at the heart of NVIDIA’s culture. In fiscal year 2025, NVIDIAians donated nearly $27 million and logged over 78,000 volunteer hours to support more than 9,000 nonprofits in nearly 70 countries.

Extraordinary people come to NVIDIA to do their life’s work—and stay. Our remarkably low 2.5% turnover rate, compared to the industry average of 16.4%, reflects that. One in five employees has been with NVIDIA for a decade or longer.

AI represents a generational opportunity on the scale of the IBM System 360 or the advent of the internet. But the impact of the AI revolution will surpass anything we’ve seen before.

NVIDIA isn’t just part of this revolution—we’re powering it. It’s a privilege to contribute to this moment—and a responsibility we carry with pride.

# Energy, Efficiency, and Climate

## Product Energy Efficiency

Improving performance and energy efficiency is a principal goal in each step of our research, development, and design processes. We develop hardware, software, and networking technology to improve performance and energy efficiency, helping our customers solve problems and decrease emissions intensity.

Frontier AI models continue to increase in complexity and size as they enhance generative AI and enable scientific discoveries, and modern data centers require accelerated computing platforms to effectively execute these workloads. **Accelerated computing** is the use of specialized hardware to dramatically speed up computation by parallel processing that bundles frequently occurring tasks. It offloads demanding work that can bog down traditional processors that typically execute tasks in serial fashion, and offers lower overall costs, higher performance, and greater energy efficiency.

Acceleration completes larger workloads more quickly, returning the computer to a low-power idle state when done and consuming significantly less energy overall when compared to traditional computing.

NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra GPUs are generally over 50X more energy efficient than traditional CPUs for large language model (LLM) AI inference workloads, and NVIDIA DPUs can reduce power consumption by 30% by offloading essential data center networking and infrastructure functions from less efficient CPUs. If AI, HPC, and data analytics workloads were switched from CPU infrastructure to GPU and DPU-accelerated operations, we estimate the world could save almost 40 trillion watt-hours of energy a year, equivalent to the electricity requirements of nearly 5 million U.S. homes.

Energy efficiency is critical as AI models and HPC applications increase exponentially in

AI workloads such as LLMs range in size from small-scale like GPT-J (6 billion parameters) to larger-scale like GPT-3 (175 billion parameters), and massive LLMs now extend further into multi-trillion parameter scale. The NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip has demonstrated 25x energy efficiency over the prior NVIDIA Hopper™ generation for inference of massive LLMs, while CPUs have not demonstrated an ability to effectively run the largest LLMs.

In March 2025, NVIDIA announced throughput-related innovations that dramatically improve the energy efficiency of inference at scale, even within the Blackwell platform. Moving from the Blackwell NVL8 system at FP8 to Blackwell NVL72 at FP4, for example, we demonstrated an improvement in scaled inference efficiency, measured in million tokens per second per megawatt, of nearly 2x–130x*. In other words, our newest system offers almost 50%-99% reduction in energy consumption for the same performance (inference throughput and response time).

We’re excited to announce that NVIDIA has committed to two new emission reduction targets. Both targets were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C.

We commit to the following science-based targets from a FY23 base year:

> To reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions 50% by FY30
>
> To reduce scope 3 emissions intensity from use of sold GPU products by 75% per PFLOP by FY30

Reducing energy and emissions per computation represents NVIDIA’s biggest opportunity to reduce emissions and to support global sustainability efforts. Our scope 3 target is measured in PFLOP, or PetaFLOP, which represents one quadrillion (10^15) floating-point operations per second. This is a common industry standard for measuring computational performance capacity.

We plan to publish our FY26 progress toward these targets by next year, along with a complete inventory of NVIDIA’s significant scope 3 emissions.

To bring a more structured approach to managing energy efficiency at several of our key data center locations, we have an energy management system certified to the ISO 50001 standard, which covered approximately 41% of our data center energy use in FY25. Our certification to the ISO 50001 standard recognizes our efforts to properly measure and reduce energy consumption in our data centers.

## Energy-Efficient Operations

Two of our headquarters buildings in Santa Clara, CA, and our Hyderabad, India campus are LEED Gold certified. These buildings were designed to be energy and water efficient, built with sustainable raw materials and improved indoor environmental quality. For our Santa Clara campus, the two buildings are connected by a three-acre park which is provided with shade by trellis that houses 390 kW of solar panels. These solar panels bring the total onsite solar generation capacity at our headquarters to 845 kW. In FY24, in support of our renewable electricity goal, we also added solar panels at our Hyderabad campus.

In FY25, we increased the amount of our renewable electricity use to 100% for offices and data centers under our operational control,

achieving our target. Our renewable electricity sourcing includes on-site renewables and purchasing utility renewable electricity tariffs, energy attribute certificates and purchase power agreements. We are exploring additional options to increase our sourcing of renewable energy for our growing footprint.

We plan to continue our goal of **100%** renewable electricity use annually.

## Waste Management

We aim to reduce the amount of waste we send to landfill through waste reduction, reuse, and recycling initiatives. We engaged a vendor to complete a gap analysis of our Santa Clara campus to better understand opportunities to increase our landfill diversion rate and minimize the amount of waste generated.

For products we use for testing, R&D, and production purposes, we have programs in place to support internal re-use of equipment that hasn’t reached the end of its useful life or financial depreciation life. We properly

<page_number>12</page_number># Water Conservation

We use water in our direct operations in cooling towers and for food service, landscaping, and sanitation. We take steps to use water efficiently, particularly in locations that are vulnerable to drought conditions. We also conduct an annual water risk assessment for all NVIDIA facilities and data centers, which helps us understand which sites are located in water-stressed areas.

Our two LEED Gold certified buildings in Santa Clara, CA, incorporate a range of water-efficient measures. Through the installation of low-flow bathroom fixtures and the use of recycled water for toilet flushing, the buildings are designed to achieve reductions in domestic water demand and potable water use for sewage conveyance when compared with buildings of standard design. We use reclaimed water in cooling towers and landscape irrigation systems and capture rainwater in bioswales. The three-acre park that connects the two buildings is planted with drought-tolerant trees and the greenery is irrigated by reclaimed water.

Outside of Santa Clara, our Hyderabad, India, site has a water treatment plant that reuses the site’s treated wastewater for landscape irrigation.

## dispose of IT assets and used laptops are sold to a vendor for refurbishment and reuse, with a portion of the financial proceeds donated to the NVIDIA Foundation. For used equipment, we use a global specialist e-waste recycling vendor. All our vendors follow strict certification guidelines and procedures to ensure proper tracking of the chain of custody, decommissioning, data erasure, and recycling of broken or unusable hardware.

## Energy, Efficiency, and Climate

We’re introducing closed-loop liquid cooling systems across our data centers to reduce water usage and improve cooling efficiency. These systems circulate an engineered fluid—typically a mixture of propylene glycol, water, and corrosion inhibitors—within a sealed loop, eliminating the need for evaporative cooling and significantly reducing water consumption. For example, the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale, liquid-cooled system, built on the NVIDIA Blackwell platform, offers exceptional performance while balancing energy costs and heat. It packs unprecedented compute density into each server rack, delivering 30x higher throughput, 25x more energy efficiency, and 300x more water efficiency than traditional air-cooled architectures.

We want NVIDIA to be a place where people can grow their careers over their lifetime. To ensure our continued success, we maintain a working environment where our employees are engaged and inspired.

To evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party platform. Pulse surveys help us gain insight into employee experience and provide employee-generated ideas so that we can take targeted action. This agile approach allows us to hear from employees more frequently and stay focused on specific areas, while reacting quickly to current events. The suggestion box is an always-on, interactive tool where employees share their thoughts and vote on ideas about making our company a better place to work.

In addition, our CEO discusses our quarterly results, shares the vision for the company, and responds to questions from employees during our quarterly Company meetings.

We support a flexible work environment allowing us to recruit the very best employees, regardless of where they live. This flexibility supports diverse hiring and retention of talent, including working parents and other caregivers and employee engagement, which we believe makes NVIDIA a great place to work. To give employees time to recharge, we provide eight free days per year when all NVIDIANs disconnect and recharge, which were a direct result of employee feedback for structured time off.

Our employees tend to come and stay. NVIDIA’s overall turnover of 2.5% remains extremely low compared with the semiconductor industry average of 16.4%. The turnover rate for women and men has been similar in the past several years.

## Responsible Sourcing

We define human rights as the fundamental rights, freedoms, and standards of treatment belonging to all humans. We seek to promote human rights throughout our supply chain and expect our suppliers to respect human rights whenever they provide products or services for us. For our efforts related to human rights in our supply chain, see our [Human Rights](Human Rights) section. NVIDIA's supplier selection process incorporates social and environmental factors, including risk analysis on topics such as RBA code alignment, product compliance, and environmental initiatives.

We hold ourselves and our suppliers to the highest standards of behavior, and only engage suppliers that share our values. We closely manage our supply chain to deliver innovative products that satisfy our customers' expectations in a socially and environmentally conscious manner.

## Responsible Minerals

NVIDIA is committed to the responsible sourcing of minerals. We support, contribute to, and rely on industry-wide efforts to validate the source of minerals used in our products, aiming to ensure that they come from socially responsible sources and don't contribute to human conflict. Our goal is to use only conflict-free gold, tantalum, tungsten, and tin (3TG) in our products and to achieve 100% Responsible Minerals Assurance Process-compliant 3TG processing facilities.

We evaluate smelter metrics and share an annual update in our [Conflict Minerals Report](Conflict Minerals Report). We've successfully removed non-compliant 3TG smelters and refiners from our supply chain to help us meet this goal. During the reporting period, 100% of our suppliers and component manufacturers responded with the requested information.

We also collect non-3TG smelter data for cobalt and mica from our strategic suppliers and report the initial results to customers. As the cobalt and mica programs through the RBA's Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) mature, our goal is to only source from conflict-free refiners.

Our [Responsible Minerals Policy](Responsible Minerals Policy), sourcing goals, and steps for monitoring our supply chain for conflict minerals is framed around the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (CAHRA). This provides detailed recommendations to help companies respect human rights and avoid contributing to conflict through their mineral purchasing decisions and practices.

Our conflict minerals due diligence program is designed to conform in all major respects with the framework recommended by the OECD. We've established a company management program endorsed by our Executive Vice President, Operations. We identify and assess the risks in our supply chain and have adopted a strategy and process for responding to the risks we've identified. As part of our diligence process, we review smelter data published by the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process, or RMAP, of the RMI, as well as with the smelters that were audited by the London Bullion Market Association, or LBMA, the Responsible Jewelry Council, or RJC, and the Tungsten Industry—Conflict Minerals Council, or TI-CMC. These groups carry out independent third-party audits of due diligence at identified points in the supply chain to verify a smelter compliance status. Finally, NVIDIA makes various reports on our supply chain due diligence, including internally to management and externally through our [Form SD](Form SD).

## Responsible Supply Chain

We’ve expanded our supplier relationships to build redundancy and resilience in our operations to provide long-term manufacturing capacity aligned with growing customer demand. Our supply chain is mainly concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region. We use foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, or Samsung, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We purchase memory from SK Hynix Inc., Micron Technology, Inc., and Samsung. We use CoWoS technology for semiconductor packaging. We engage with independent subcontractors and contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Wistron Corporation, and Fabrinet, to perform assembly, testing, and packaging of our final products.

### Strategic Suppliers

Strategic suppliers include those who produce or handle NVIDIA production materials, those for whom we closely manage quality requirements, those who design our branded products, and those who we’re required to work with based on customer agreements.

For strategic suppliers, agreements are deployed and tracked through a Quarterly Business Review (QBR) or a Semi-annual Business Review (SBR) process to ensure they meet our expectations, which may influence our business allocation decisions. Five percent of the QBR score is based on environmental and social performance, and expectations vary by quarter. Each quarter, we assess these suppliers by product category and rank performance, and we perform an annual risk assessment based on RBA results, geography, and type of industry. We’ve assessed and adjusted business with suppliers who don’t comply with minimum requirements.

We review all strategic suppliers against NVIDIA cybersecurity requirements and have performed a more in-depth assessment of higher-risk suppliers. We looked at our suppliers’ conformance to ISO 27001, ISO 28001, C-TPAT, and NIST standards and evaluated them for additional information-, product-, and physical-security expectations. If gaps are discovered, we expect an improvement plan to align with NVIDIA requirements. The cybersecurity risk rank determines supplier risk to be low, moderate, or high, and assessments or audits are conducted on a one- to three-year cycle based on our risk analysis.

---

**Message From Our CEO**

We’re a member of the Public Private Alliance (PPA) for Responsible Minerals Trade and the RMI. The PPA provides funding and coordination support to organizations working within the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjacent countries to develop verifiable conflict-free supply chains, align due diligence programs and practices, encourage responsible sourcing from the region, promote transparency, and bolster in-region civil society and governmental capacity. We support these on-the-ground programs aimed at improving transparency for responsible sourcing and reducing human rights risks, including forced labor.

Additionally, we participate in various RMI work groups and align our program with the organization’s tracking of additional minerals and materials, as well as CAHRAs. We monitor additional legal requirements, including the EU Conflict Minerals Regulations, to determine any future obligations regarding conflict materials and high-risk regions of the world.

<page_number>19</page_number># Risk Assessment and Auditing

All our manufacturing suppliers are expected to comply with the RBA Code of Conduct and associated NVIDIA policies, including our Agreement for Manufacturer Environmental Compliance. Since 2016, all NVIDIA Master Service Agreements executed with suppliers require compliance with the RBA Code of Conduct.

Our assessment process involves using the RBA-Online system to evaluate existing and potential new suppliers against product compliance industry standards, social and environmental criteria, use of conflict minerals, the RBA Code of Conduct, and NVIDIA’s code of conduct. All suppliers are expected to conduct an annual self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ), and we expect biennial Validated Assessment Program (VAP) on-site, third-party audits to validate the SAQ. We use the results of the assessment, which includes a spending analysis, to determine their overall risk.

To ensure consistency, suppliers can share VAP audits with customers. Any uncovered findings are also made available to those customers. Findings are aggregated anonymously by the RBA and disclosed in their public annual report.

Common audit findings include issues related to freely chosen employment, working hours, wages and benefits, emergency preparedness, and occupational safety. NVIDIA ensures suppliers close all corrective actions in compliance with its Full RBA membership tier.

Our goal is to audit 100% of our strategic suppliers every two years. In FY25, we reviewed VAP audits on 48% of our strategic suppliers, bringing total audits in the past two years to 91%. We engaged 100% of strategic suppliers on their corrective action plans and continue monitoring suppliers to ensure compliance.

## Product Environmental Impact

To understand the greenhouse gas emissions generated across our product lifecycle and in manufacturing, we perform third-party verified Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) and Product Carbon Footprints (PCFs) aligned with ISO international standards. In FY26, we published a PCF summary for our NVIDIA HGX™ H100 GPU baseboard. The PCF was developed in conformance with the ISO 14067:2018 standard and was verified by a third party. It is a cradle-to-gate study including impacts from raw material extraction and refinement, material transport, component manufacturing, and assembly.

We collaborate with our suppliers to collect product-specific data for high-impact components, improving data quality, relevance, and precision. This approach replaces generic industry average data with precise, supplier-specific information, enabling us to identify key decarbonization levers within our supply chain. Looking ahead, we intend to expand our LCA product portfolio, enhance our LCA models with more accurate and granular component data for high-volume products, and further integrate supplier-specific data to provide a comprehensive and precise assessment of our products’ environmental footprint.

## Manufacturing

Emissions are generated at every stage of our product lifecycle, including manufacturing within our supply chain. Since 2014, we’ve expected our key silicon manufacturing and systems contract manufacturing suppliers to report their annual energy and water usage, waste, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and reduction goals and objectives through the RBA Environmental Survey or CDP. We also expect suppliers to have their GHG emissions verified by a third party. We use this supplier data to better understand our product manufacturing impact and allocate carbon emissions to our customers.

We accomplished our goal to engage manufacturing suppliers to effect supplier adoption of science-based targets. In FY25, we engaged suppliers totaling over 80% of our scope 3 category 1 emissions.

We maintain Full Material Disclosures for our chip designs and select system products, which demonstrates our compliance with restricted substances including halogenated flame retardants, arsenic, and beryllium. Information on materials we use is reported through various platforms, including Substances of Concern in Products and International Material Data System for automotive.

## Packaging

We continue to optimize the balance between ensuring that customers receive products in a protected, like-new condition while also minimizing our impact on the environment. We actively seek opportunities and implement appropriate solutions to reduce our usage of non-recyclable materials and packaging materials in general,

NVIDIA-branded products are subject to electronic waste disposal requirements in our various global markets, and we take seriously our extended responsibility for these products. In key regions such as the U.S. and Europe, we've established recycling programs in partnership with reputable third parties and provide information to consumers about how to recycle our branded products through labeling and our [website](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about-nvidia/sustainability/).

## Product Quality and Safety

Safety is a principle that permeates our engineering culture. We incorporate it into every step of our product development process, from design and production to the end-user experience.

Our products undergo rigorous qualification and testing to ensure compliance with customer safety and reliability standards. With these standards in mind, we've established product safety technical committees to oversee safety throughout the product lifecycle.

Cross-functional teams manage all aspects of product quality. Customer quality engineering provides direct customer support for all quality-related issues, gathers information on customer failures and customer-observed failure rates, and processes returned material authorization.

As part of the continuous improvement process, recommended design enhancements are brought to the engineering teams for incorporation into next-generation products. We monitor our quality-management system through internal audits and an annual third-party [ISO 9001](https://www.iso.org/) assessment.

**Our Code**

Our code of conduct outlines our core values and establishes the expectations we have about how we conduct business. It guides our actions in our professional relationships with fellow employees, as well as our customers, partners, competitors, vendors, government regulators, shareholders, and the community at large. Our code applies to all employees, board members, and we expect all third parties we do business with, including consultants, contractors, and other service providers, to act in a manner consistent with it.

Our Code is translated into 13 different languages, which are available on our [website](#).

**Ethics and Cybersecurity**

We strive to achieve the highest standards of ethical conduct in all our business dealings and are committed to promoting a culture of integrity. NVIDIA employees receive code of conduct training upon hire and then every two years thereafter. This training covers topics like ethics, preventing workplace harassment, and sustainability. Employees who have frequent contact with customers, partners, and suppliers (such as those in sales, finance, and procurement) complete additional global anti-bribery and anti-corruption training.

In addition to employee cybersecurity trainings, our Santa Clara headquarters is certified to ISO 27001. For more information on our approach to cybersecurity, see pp. 32 of our [2025 Form 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1246898/0001193125-21-00001/nvidia_2025_form_10-k.pdf) filed with the SEC.

**Investigations Process**

Our commitment to promoting a culture of integrity means everyone is expected to act ethically and feel empowered to voice concerns without fear of retaliation.

Anyone can confidentially and anonymously submit a complaint about any matter of concern using our [Speak Up](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about/speak-up/) corporate hotline which is hosted by an independent third party. These include accounting, internal controls, auditing, code of conduct, harassment, conflict of interest, or other potential code of conduct, policy, or legal violations.

Employees are encouraged to report suspected code and other policy violations to their manager, a human resources representative, the legal department, and/or the anonymous hotline. We use an external organization for our Speak Up

NVIDIA’s Compliance Legal ensures communication of and adherence to all NVIDIA policies; establishes procedures for the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints; and promptly and thoroughly conducts investigations in partnership with relevant organizations within NVIDIA. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees the Compliance Committee and periodically reviews our policies, practices, and investigation procedures in connection with our compliance program.

The Compliance Committee periodically reviews and assesses the effectiveness of its procedures and adjusts as necessary. Our third-party auditor reviews cases quarterly and process updates annually.

Employees who wish to understand NVIDIA’s investigations process have access to an online training course.

# Trustworthy AI

We endeavor to deliver AI models that:

*   Comply with privacy and data protection laws,
*   Perform safely and as intended,
*   Communicate transparently about a model’s design and limitations, and
*   Minimize unwanted bias and give all groups equal opportunity to benefit from AI.

Our **Trustworthy AI principles**, which we share with our employees, customers, and partners, reflect our core values and [code of conduct](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about/our-code-of-conduct/).

## Scope and Governance

To build **Trustworthy AI** (TAI), we develop practices, methodologies, and tools for datasets, machine learning frameworks, AI model development, and software development and testing. We build tools and processes that enable us, our customers and partners, and the ecosystem to build AI that’s safe and trustworthy.

Our TAI efforts are led by a head of AI & Legal Ethics and supported by dedicated product and risk teams. These teams are structured to work cross-functionally with product, product security, safety, and infrastructure teams to ensure our AI aligns to our principles. The teams also participate in external AI safety standards development efforts to contribute industry best practices.

Our global public policy team monitors global regulations and relevant standards to ensure that we maintain compliance. The internal **AI Ethics Committee** advises on generative AI development with members of our engineering, business, and legal organizations. In FY25, we introduced new training opportunities including a monthly webinar and special-TAI volunteer task forces to educate teams on how TAI principles are applied to product development and releases.

## Standards and Frameworks

We look to global frameworks such as the EU’s High-Level Expert group on Artificial Intelligence and Singapore’s Model Artificial

Intelligence Governance Framework to guide our software development processes, from concept to performance validation to decommission. We participate in industry-driven initiatives like [ML Commons](https://mlcommons.org/), as well as standards bodies like the IEEE Organizational Governance of Artificial Intelligence Working Group. NVIDIA is also a member of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [AI Safety Institute Consortium](https://nist.gov/ai-safety-institute-consortium) and the [Content Authenticity Initiative](https://contentauthenticity.org/), which are focused on the development and use of safe and trustworthy AI systems. In FY25, NVIDIA joined the UK AI Security Institute and [published](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about/ai-security/) a paper on Frontier AI Risk. This aligns with our commitments to the U.S. Voluntary Commitments and our aim to uphold state-of-the-art practices in trustworthy AI.

NVIDIA also helped [launch](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about/ai-research-national-science-foundation/) the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource in partnership with the National Science Foundation, which aims to broaden access to the tools needed to power responsible AI discovery and innovation.

## Model Risk Management

NVIDIA aims to reduce the risk of harm from deployment of AI models or systems. Model risk can come from many sources, including training datasets, malicious attacks, or failure to comply with laws and regulations.

<footer>NVIDIA Sustainability | Responsible Business</footer>
<page_number>23</page_number><header>NVIDIA Sustainability | Responsible Business</header>

# Model Card Improvements

Model cards are documents that detail how machine learning (ML) models work, ensuring clear communication about how NVIDIA technology was made and should be used by developers working with our AI models. Model cards detail information about the ML model’s metadata, including the datasets that it’s based on, performance measures that it was trained on, and the deep learning training methodology itself.

We’ve enhanced our model cards to make them more understandable to consumers, investors, and policy makers. Those enhancements focused on improved readability with clearer language, increased detail around ethical considerations, and greater accessibility. In FY25, we open-sourced the Model Card++ template for industry to adopt and continuously update Model Card++ content and format and began automating the model card workflow.

## AI Safety

As LLMs become more widespread, the content safety risks associated with their use also increase. Nemo Guardrail’s Security Guidelines sets out guidelines and principles for providing LLMs access to external data and compute resources in a safe and secure way. To evaluate the safety of our models, we employ AEGIS, a high quality content safety evaluation dataset, LLM-based content safety classifier model, and evaluation benchmark from NVIDIA. AEGIS is backed by a broad content safety risk taxonomy that covers 12 critical risks in human-LLM interactions, such as content including hate/identity hate, harassment, or violence.

Alongside content safety, it’s important to assess generative models for security weaknesses. Garak—Generative AI Red-teaming & Assessment Kit—is a vulnerability scanner for LLMs. It identifies a broad range of security weaknesses and unwanted behaviors in language model-based technology. Garak can scan a model or dialog system and quickly discover where it’s working well, and where it may be vulnerable to attack. Garak provides full reporting, detailing what worked and what could use improvement.

Deploying safeguards across various points in a model’s architecture ensures that if one layer is compromised, others remain effective. This approach enhances resilience against potential threats by providing redundant protective measures. Guardrails can be implemented at various locations in the model architecture:

<img>Green house icon located at the top-right corner of the page.</img>

## We’ve designed and continue to improve tools for internal developers to create TAI models:

- Integrated third-party tools from QuantPi and others to conduct independent testing of high-risk models.
- Collaborated with an external law firm to automate the identification of legal obligations when models are registered in our internal inventory.
- Created a dashboard that measures a model’s completion of essential steps prior to publication, including a current performance score and target goal.
- Implemented model requirement and dataset approval processes that must be met prior to commercial and noncommercial releases.
- Released model cards that accompany our published models, providing guidance on a model’s uses and limitations, including ethical considerations such as explainability and privacy.

**500+**

NVIDIA models across all domains meet the Model Card++ standard.

<page_number>24</page_number>> Input rails are guardrails applied to the input from the user. An input rail can reject the input, stopping any additional processing, or alter the input (e.g., to mask potentially sensitive data, to rephrase).

> Dialog rails influence how the LLM is prompted. They operate on canonical form messages and determine if an action should be executed, if the LLM should be invoked to generate the next step or a response, or if a predefined response should be used instead, etc.

> Retrieval rails are guardrails applied to the retrieved chunks in the case of a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) scenario. A retrieval rail can reject a chunk, preventing it from being used to prompt the LLM, or alter the relevant chunks (e.g., to mask potentially sensitive data).

> Execution rails are guardrails applied to input/output of the custom actions (a.k.a. tools) that need to be called by the LLM.

> Output rails are guardrails applied to the output generated by the LLM. An output rail can reject the output, preventing it from being returned to the user, or alter it (e.g., removing sensitive data). NVIDIA Cosmos™ post-Guard stage blocks harmful visual outputs using a video content safety classifier and a face blur filter.

In addition to automated safety evaluation with systems like AEGIS and Garak, Human Content Red Teaming further evaluates models using human interaction and evaluation of the models’ responses.

## Human Rights

The NCG Committee has oversight of policies and practices in connection with human rights and provides periodic updates to the Board. At the management level, our Sustainability Steering Committee is responsible for reviewing and ensuring the effectiveness of our human rights program. Through this governance body and related executive engagement,

management undertakes all actions it deems reasonable and necessary to ensure compliance with our **Human Rights Policy**.

We regularly assess human rights-related risks and potential impacts, review our policies and management processes, and seek input from stakeholders on our approach. In FY25, NVIDIA commissioned an independent firm to conduct a human rights saliency assessment of potential human rights impacts across our value chain. The expert consulted internal and external stakeholders and reviewed international principles and norms to identify human rights risks and opportunities salient to NVIDIA’s business. Stakeholder groups within the company then validated the results.

## Human Rights Principles

We follow the laws of the countries in which we operate and endorse internationally recognized principles, including:

- United Nations Global Compact  
- United Nations Guiding Principles  
- Universal Declaration of Human Rights  
- International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  
- International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights  
- Core Conventions of the International Labour Organization  
- ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work  

The saliency assessment identified five salient human rights risk areas for NVIDIA: responsible minerals sourcing; working conditions in the supply chain; clean, healthy, sustainable environment; responsible product development; and responsible product use.

We plan to use the results of the assessment to guide the enhancement of NVIDIA’s human rights policy and program. In FY26, we’ll review and update our Human Rights and Responsible Minerals policies. The assessment will also support the enhancement of our human rights program as we continue to work to address salient risks, building out programming, and diligence.

All NVIDIA employees are required to complete training on our code, which includes our commitment and guidelines to respect human rights. Additionally, certain employees take RBA e-Learning Academy courses and are engaged in RBA workgroups relevant to our supply chain operations.

Employees, suppliers, and other external stakeholders can confidentially and anonymously report a concern about human rights using our Speak-Up line, which is available in seven languages. Our investigations team will promptly investigate human rights allegations it becomes aware of through our Speak Up line and present any findings to

NVIDIA Sustainability | Responsible Business

<page_number>25</page_number>the Compliance Committee that require the input of that committee. We do not tolerate retaliation against anyone for making a complaint in good faith, bringing a potential violation to the attention of management, or participating or assisting in an investigation.

NVIDIA has been a signatory of the UN Global Compact since June 2022. We’re also a member of the Responsible Labor Initiative (RLI), the Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade (PPA), and the Responsible Minerals Initiative.

**Upstream Human Rights**

We take the issue of forced labor very seriously and conduct regular audits to ensure all workers in our supply chain are treated with respect and dignity. We’re full members of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and work with them and similar industry groups to prevent and eliminate forced labor from global supply chains. Through the RBA, we also work with expert organizations, NGOs, and academia to advance our program and standards, and we support efforts at an industry level to identify and remediate actual

and potential cases of labor and human rights abuse. Our supplier audits haven’t identified incidents of forced Uyghur labor.

We expect our suppliers to maintain progressive employment, health, safety, and ethical practices that meet or exceed applicable laws, the [RBA Code of Conduct](https://www.responsiblebusiness.org/), our [Code of Conduct](https://www.responsiblebusiness.org/), and our [Human Rights Policy](https://www.responsiblebusiness.org/). We also encourage suppliers to use the RBA Code of Conduct as a platform to go above and beyond compliance. We participate in RBA’s Responsible Labor Initiative (RLI) and monitor our supply chain through VAP audits, which cover freely chosen employment, child labor, and freedom of association.

In FY25, we reviewed VAP audits on 48% of our strategic suppliers, bringing total audits in the past two years to 91%. If we uncover findings during these audits, we work directly with suppliers to implement any corrective actions. Accordingly, we worked with certain suppliers to track working hours, to address and comply with policies related to document retention, and to address and comply with zero hiring fees.

# U.N. Sustainable Development Goals

We continue to align our business activities to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Here are a few ways we contributed to the SDGs in FY25.

## SDG 3 GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING

### Our Support
Our employees’ well-being, physical, emotional, and financial health is a top priority, and we aim to support them by **offering** a suite of services where people can choose what works best for them. We partner with NVIDIA’s 10 different community resource groups to enhance support programs based on targeted needs, including military leave, student loan repayment, gender affirmation support, enhanced health insurance coverage for members with developmental delays, and mental health counselor search tools.

### Our Impact
NVIDIA supported Evo 2, the largest publicly available AI model for genomic data, that was built on the NVIDIA DGX Cloud platform in a collaboration led by nonprofit biomedical research organization Arc Institute and Stanford University. In healthcare and drug discovery, Evo 2 could help researchers understand which gene variants are tied to a specific disease and design novel molecules that precisely target those areas to treat the disease.

<img>SDG 3 Good Health and Well-Being icon</img>

## SDG 4 QUALITY EDUCATION

### Our Support
To diversify our university pipeline, we continue to invest in entry-level feeder programs around the world, including the **NVIDIA Ignite** program that prepares first- and second-year college students for an NVIDIA internship the following summer. We implement tools to help us identify a wider pool of diverse talent in the student population, and our recruitment efforts in the U.S. attracted underrepresented applicants through virtual and on-campus events.

### Our Impact
In FY25, NVIDIA and the State of California announced a partnership with a first-of-its-kind AI education initiative. It enables educators to gain certification through the NVIDIA **Deep Learning Institute University Ambassador Program**, which connects instructors with high-quality teaching kits, workshop content, and NVIDIA GPU-accelerated workstations in the cloud.

<img>SDG 4 Quality Education icon</img>

## SDG 5 GENDER EQUALITY

### Our Support
We strive to provide equitable compensation and opportunities for advancement to all employees and to achieve promotion parity based on a variety of considerations. We provide employees with **benefits** such as reimbursement for eligible adoption, surrogacy, and fertility treatment expenses.

### Our Impact
NVIDIA’s **Inception Program** provides free support to over 22,000 startups, including Karya, a startup in India leveraging NVIDIA technology to serve the country’s multilingual population and scale globally. Karya is employing over 30,000 low-income women participants across six language groups in India to help create a gender-intentional, open-source dataset that will support the creation of diverse AI applications across agriculture, healthcare, and banking.

<img>SDG 5 Gender Equality icon</img>

## SDG 9 INDUSTRY, INNOVATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

### Our Support
We believe AI should respect privacy and data protection regulations, operate in a secure and safe way, function in a transparent and accountable manner, and avoid unwanted biases and discrimination. **Trustworthy AI** principles are foundational to our end-to-end development and essential for the technical excellence that enables partners, customers, and developers to do their best work.

### Our Impact
We’ve enhanced our model cards to make them more understandable to consumers, investors, and policy makers. Those enhancements focused on improved readability with clearer language, increased detail around ethical considerations, and greater accessibility everywhere our models are made available. In FY25, as part of our commitment to Trustworthy AI, NVIDIA **open-sourced** the template for industry to adopt and continuously update Model Card++ content and format and began working on automating the model card workflow.

<img>SDG 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure icon</img>

## SDG 13 CLIMATE ACTION

### Our Support
To manage the GHG emissions footprint of our data centers, labs, and offices, we focus on siting expansions strategically, managing our operations efficiently, and sourcing renewable energy. We achieved our goal of 100% renewable electricity, reducing our GHG footprint to zero Scope 2 market-based emissions.

### Our Impact
The NVIDIA Earth-2 platform now features a generative AI weather model, NVIDIA CorrDiff, that enables kilometer-scale forecasts of wind, temperature, and precipitation type and amount. Weather agencies and startups across the globe are adopting CorrDiff and other Earth-2 tools to improve the resolution and precision of forecasts for extreme weather phenomena, renewable energy management, and agricultural planning.

We welcome feedback on this report and our performance. Send comments and suggestions to NVIDIACorporateSustainability@nvidia.com.

The discussion of topics included in this report and our other corporate responsibility disclosures should not be read as implying that such topics are “material” in the context of the U.S. federal securities laws, Delaware General Corporation Law, or any other regulatory framework, even where we use words such as “material” or “materiality”. Our approach to sustainability disclosures is informed by reporting frameworks, such as the GRI, that involve broader definitions of materiality than used for purposes of our compliance with SEC disclosure obligations. As a result, “materiality” for purposes of our sustainability reporting includes impacts on communities, the environment, and stakeholders such as employees, customers, and suppliers, and the inclusion of topics in our sustainability reporting, even when described as “material,” does not indicate that such topics are material to the Company’s business, operations, or financial condition.

NVIDIA’s reporting follows our fiscal calendar, FY25 data corresponds to the period January 29, 2024, to January 26, 2025. The information contained in this report is accurate as of approximately June 12, 2025, unless stated otherwise. The information is subject to change, and NVIDIA will not necessarily disclose such changes. The information may be updated, amended, supplemented, or otherwise altered by subsequent reports or filings by NVIDIA.

Certain statements included or incorporated by reference in this report, other than statements or characterizations of historical fact, including, but not limited to, statements as to: our growth; our market opportunities; the performance, impact, and benefits of our products and technologies; our strategies; our priorities, goals, and objectives; market trends; future forecasts; and other predictions and estimates are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are subject to the “safe harbor” created by those sections and are based on our current expectations, estimates, and projections about our industry and our management’s beliefs and assumptions. We caution readers that these statements are merely predictions and are not guarantees of future results. Actual events may differ materially, perhaps adversely. In particular, goals and targets described in this report are aspirational and not guarantees or promises that the goals or targets will be met.

Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and other filings made with the SEC discuss some of the important risk factors that could contribute to differences between projections and outcomes, which could affect our business, operational results, and financial condition. Except as required by law, NVIDIA does not recognize any obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements.

Historical and forward-looking statements contained in this report may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. Such historical and forward-looking statements may be subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such information and may include estimates or approximations. We believe that such estimates are appropriate and reasonable; however, due to inherent uncertainties in making estimates and assumptions, actual results could differ from the original estimates. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. As we improve our methodologies and as new information becomes available, we may continue to revise our estimates and assumptions.

This report also includes certain information, including with respect to emissions factors, that is obtained from published sources or third parties. The accuracy and completeness of such information are not guaranteed. Such information is subject to assumptions, estimates, and other uncertainties, and we have not independently verified this information.
