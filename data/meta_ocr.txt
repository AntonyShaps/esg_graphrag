# Climate

We are taking a multifaceted approach to implementing emissions reduction strategies that includes procuring clean and renewable energy and exploring innovative technologies like energy storage and geothermal energy. As a result of our clean and renewable energy procurement, we have reduced our emissions by 23.8 million metric tons (M MT) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) since 2021. Wind and solar projects supported by Meta over the last decade are adding more than 15 gigawatts (GW) of clean and renewable energy to grids globally. Additionally, we are embedding circularity principles across our operations and exploring technologies like low carbon fuels and construction materials to reduce our emissions.

The majority of our emissions are connected to our supply chain, and we are engaging with our suppliers to accelerate their efforts to reduce their emissions. By the end of 2024, 48% of our suppliers, based on their contribution to our emissions, have set science-aligned emissions reduction targets.

<img>A landscape photo showing a misty mountain range with green trees in the foreground.</img>

Because our data centers are responsible for the bulk of our water use, we focus most of our reduction efforts in that space. Data centers rely on water for managing temperature and humidity. Our data centers are designed with increasingly water efficient features. Water-budgeting and flow meter audits help us track and further reduce water use.

# Water

We organize our water stewardship efforts around minimizing water use, transparently reporting our water data, and supporting water restoration projects.

Since 2017, Meta has supported over 40 water restoration projects across nine watersheds. In 2024 alone, operational water restoration projects returned more than 1.6 billion gallons of water to high and medium water stress regions. We work collectively as part of the [Water Resilience Coalition](https://waterresiliencemovement.org/) of the [UN CEO Water Mandate](https://www.unceowatermandate.org/), focusing on corporate water stewardship.

# Responsible Supply Chain

Our responsible supply chain program strives to empower workers and protect the environment. Integrating sustainability criteria into supplier performance management supports the broader business goals by helping to manage labor, health and safety, human rights, and environmental risks in the manufacturing supply chain.

In 2024, we reached more than 60,000 manufacturing workers through capacity building initiatives to build knowledge, skills, and management systems on human rights and environmental compliance topics.<header>2025 Meta Sustainability Report</header>
<page_number>5</page_number>

# Biodiversity

We seek opportunities to protect and promote biodiversity across our operations and facilities. Our standard data center design dedicates the vast majority of unbuilt outdoor spaces to restore native habitat and largely eliminates turf and exotic ornamental species. By the end of 2024, more than 50% of our owned data center campus footprint was planned, installed, or preserved to intentionally support local, native, biodiverse habitats. That equals more than 4,000 acres.

When possible, we partner with local groups to support nature-based initiatives in our communities. For example, we worked with the Tennessee Environmental Council and Sumner County Schools to support the installation of 6,000 square feet of pollinator gardens in six schools near our Gallatin data center.

# Looking Forward to a Better Reality

As we press forward with our ambitious sustainability goals, we are facing increasingly complex challenges at every turn. External factors, such as the pace of technological advancements and market development for clean and renewable energy projects, and uncertain policy landscapes are adding to the complexity of our journey.

This year’s sustainability report highlights our progress, challenges, and opportunities. We are pleased by what we have achieved so far but we know there is more work to be done. We are committed to continued innovation, collaboration, and transparency as we work towards a more sustainable future.

<img>A green circular icon with a white outline of a globe.</img>

As climate change impacts become increasingly prevalent, we believe decarbonizing our business is a critical step for Meta to do our part in connecting to a healthier planet, more resilient communities, and a net zero reality.

Since 2020, we have maintained net zero emissions in our operations,¹ matched 100% of our electricity use with clean and renewable energy, and have set a goal to achieve net zero emissions across our value chain in 2030.

Our value chain emissions continue to fluctuate as our business expands and recently constructed data centers come online. This underscores the long-term efforts needed to decouple emissions growth from anticipated business growth. In order to reduce our emissions in line with our 2030 goals, we are prioritizing decarbonization measures today — both at Meta and with our suppliers — so that the design of our infrastructure and global operations are compatible with a zero-carbon future.

# Conditions for Achieving Net Zero

In our effort to achieve net zero emissions, Meta is focused on transforming our business to reduce emissions that can have the highest impact on progress toward our climate goals. We recognize that key factors will be necessary for us and our peers to achieve net zero, including:

1.  **New technologies to reduce emissions.** Technologies like innovative construction materials, clean sources of energy, new low carbon fuels, and efficient server and network hardware must continue to become more accessible to shift the way we operate our business and build our infrastructure.

2.  **Strong demand signals for climate solutions we need to scale.** We believe working with peers and joining buyers coalitions to accelerate access to climate solutions will help us achieve net zero.

3.  **Partnership with our supply chain.** As we scale our efforts to engage our suppliers to reduce their emissions, we depend on our partners to take action with a shared vision to decarbonize within their operations and across the sectors in which they operate.

4.  **Clarity on external guidance for companies to achieve net zero.** As external frameworks that define the standards for companies to calculate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and set emissions reduction targets evolve, we require clarity to reach our targets in line with a standardized approach that both aligns with a zero-carbon future and is achievable for us and our peers.

5.  **An enabling environment for a net zero world.** Collaboration between business and global coalitions is critical to scaling the climate solutions we need to reach net zero, shaping an effective transition to a low carbon economy by improving the accessibility of clean energy sources and low carbon technologies for us and our suppliers, as well as enabling certainty for businesses to access market-based mechanisms such as carbon credits.2025 Meta Sustainability Report

# Understanding Emissions

Comprehensive data and advanced tooling provide the fundamental building blocks to fully understand and effectively manage our emissions.

Identifying the sources of our emissions enables us to prioritize and deploy interventions to reduce emissions where we can make the most meaningful progress on our path to net zero.

As Meta seeks to decarbonize our value chain, the data and tooling that drive our climate work will continue to evolve and improve, particularly given the challenge to accurately measure and influence emissions reduction deep in our entire value chain. We leverage our expertise in data science to create emissions management tools for our teams and improve the granularity, accuracy, and measurement of our GHG data.

## Forecasting Future-State Emissions

Our Net Zero Hub tool forecasts our future-state emissions based on numerous data inputs, such as planned business growth, to model emissions scenarios and provides insights on how Meta is tracking toward our net zero goal. These insights enable us to optimize our emissions reduction interventions as company strategy evolves.

<img>Aerial view of a campus with buildings, green spaces, and solar panels.</img><header>2025 Meta Sustainability Report</header>

# A Unified Data Model Consolidates Thousands of Internal Data Sources

To improve consistency and reliability, we consolidate thousands of GHG data sources into a tool that helps us calculate total GHG emissions from purchased goods and services like hardware, transportation, waste, and product usage.

---

# Scenario Planning Tool Estimates Embodied Carbon of Data Centers

Our omni tool simulates the emission outputs from planned activities to reduce emissions associated with the construction of new data center buildings. For example, it allows our data center engineers to model different design choices and their potential emissions savings. This tool enables our design, engineering, and construction teams to rapidly scale new approaches to deploy low carbon materials and adapt our data center designs to help achieve our net zero goal.

---

# RETINAS: Real-Time Infrastructure Accounting for Sustainability

A new internal metric, real-time server fleet utilization effectiveness, allows us to monitor the emissions associated with the embodied carbon of our data center servers and components. As part of the [RETINAS initiative](https://www.meta.com/retinas), this metric allows us to measure server resource usage (e.g., compute, storage) and efficiency in our large-scale data center server fleet in near real-time.

<page_number>15</page_number>

<page_number>16</page_number>

# Estimating Embodied Carbon in Data Center Hardware

Calculating emissions down to individual data center components is challenging because many component manufacturers lack the scale and resources to quantify and provide GHG metrics. In response, we developed a methodology to estimate and track the carbon emissions of hundreds of millions of components in our data centers.

The methodology incorporates component-level, cost-based estimates and resource-intensive Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). We complement calculations with internal materials modeling and third party tools including imec.netzero and ACT. This suite of methods and the associated data pipelines enable a more comprehensive and detailed overview of the embodied carbon in our entire IT hardware fleet.

Meta obtains a “best estimate” embodied carbon emission factor for each of the unique IT hardware components in our data centers.

# Reducing Emissions

Reducing GHG emissions across our global operations and value chain is our top priority and the most effective strategy to reach a net zero reality.

We have set a [science-aligned emissions reduction target](https://www.meta.com/sustainability) in line with what is necessary to transition to a zero-carbon future, and we have roadmapped our strategy to systematically transform the way we do business.

## Emissions Reductions With Contractual Instruments

<img>A bar chart showing emissions reductions over four years (2021-2024). The y-axis is labeled "MT CO₂e" from 0 to 20,000,000. The x-axis shows the years 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. For each year, there are two bars: a grey bar representing "Location-based emissions" and a teal bar representing "Emissions with contractual instruments applied". The values are:
*   2021: Location-based emissions ≈ 10,000,000 MT CO₂e, Emissions with contractual instruments applied ≈ 6,000,000 MT CO₂e
*   2022: Location-based emissions ≈ 14,000,000 MT CO₂e, Emissions with contractual instruments applied ≈ 8,000,000 MT CO₂e
*   2023: Location-based emissions ≈ 14,000,000 MT CO₂e, Emissions with contractual instruments applied ≈ 7,000,000 MT CO₂e
*   2024: Location-based emissions ≈ 16,000,000 MT CO₂e, Emissions with contractual instruments applied ≈ 8,200,000 MT CO₂e
The legend on the right explains that the grey bars represent "Location-based emissions" and the teal bars represent "Emissions with contractual instruments applied".</img>

Our total 2024 emissions with contractual instruments applied (8.2 M MT CO₂e) were 48% less than our location-based emissions (15.6 M MT CO₂e). Our emissions with contractual instruments applied reflect emissions reductions from purchasing decisions we have made. Examples of this include matching 100% of the energy we use with over 15 GW of clean and renewable energy and purchasing of over 4 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel for business travel since 2021, which has up to an 80% lower carbon footprint than traditional jet fuel.<header>2025 Meta Sustainability Report</header>
<page_number>18</page_number>

# Energy

Advancing the technologies that will build the future of human connection — including the next wave of AI innovation — requires electric grids to expand and embrace new sources of reliable, clean, and renewable energy.

## Clean and Renewable Energy

For more than a decade, we have reduced emissions by ensuring our operations are supported by clean and renewable energy. We recognize that adding new energy capacity to the grid is important, not only because of our scale and scope as a company, but because we want to play a positive role in the communities in which we operate.

Since 2020, we have matched ↗ 100% of our annual electricity use with clean and renewable energy. As a voluntary buyer, we prioritize supporting high quality, innovative energy projects around the globe, which is key to maintaining net zero emissions for our operations.

A fundamental tenet of our approach to clean and renewable energy is the concept of additionality ↗: partnering with utilities and developers to add new projects to the grid. Over the last decade, we have contracted for over 15 GW of new clean and renewable energy across the globe, making us one of the world’s largest corporate buyers.

<img>Green arrow icon</img>

As a result of matching 100% of our electricity use with clean and renewable energy, we have reduced our operational emissions by 6 M MT of CO₂e in 2024. We also apply additional Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) to our Scope 3 emissions to reduce emissions such as those associated with fuel- and energy-related activities, customer use of our consumer hardware, including Meta Quest headsets, and employees working from home. As a result, we have reduced our value chain emissions by 1.4 M MT of CO₂e in 2024. Renewable energy procurement has helped us reduce our overall emissions by a total of

**23.8 M MT** of CO₂e since 2021.2025 Meta Sustainability Report
<page_number>19</page_number>

# Power Purchase Agreements

We routinely partner with energy providers on long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) to match our electricity use with clean and renewable energy.

PPAs bring energy to the grid and support projects that would otherwise not have been built. Our role in the enablement of these projects is offtaker; when developers construct and operate new projects, we purchase the energy produced.

As of the end of 2024, 89 of the 128 projects in our portfolio were online and producing power. Long-term financial commitments like these play a critical role in helping these projects get built. We often work to ensure new projects are connected to the same grid as our data centers and prioritize those that contribute the most to grid reliability (e.g., by giving energy to the grid when the grid most needs it), while optimizing for emission reductions.

## A Few Key Projects Include:

*   Partnership with Singapore renewable energy developer Sembcorp to support a 150 MW floating solar project, which will be the largest in the country once completed.
*   Partnership with Highfield Energy Services on one of the largest solar agreements in Ireland, supporting 190 MW of solar from two projects in Wexford and Meath, close to our Clonee Data Center.
*   Partnership with New Mexico energy provider PNM and NextEra Energy Resources on Sky Ranch Solar Energy Center, a 190 MW solar facility paired with a 50 MW four-hour battery energy storage system in New Mexico.

# Supporting Grid Reliability With New Energy Innovations

As electricity load grows, a diverse portfolio of resources is needed to ensure that the grid remains reliable. Meta is committed to doing our part to spur progress in bringing innovative clean and renewable energy technologies to the grid.

## Energy Storage

A broad portfolio of energy sources is vital to the modern energy grid, but incorporating wind and solar requires a way to store power for the times when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing. Meta has supported one form of energy storage technology by contracting to bring 100 MW of four-hour duration battery storage to support the grid in New Mexico. We are also using our AI capabilities to support acceleration of research in the space.

Discovering the right combination of catalysts is a time-consuming process, with billions of element combinations to test. Experimentalists using standard synthesis methods can test ten materials per day, while a modern computational laboratory using quantum mechanical simulation tools such as density functional theory (DFT) can run 40,000 simulations per year. A partnership between the Meta Fundamental AI Research Team and Carnegie Mellon University, Open Catalyst’s goal is to enable researchers to screen millions — possibly billions — of catalysts per year.

Open Catalyst aims to discover low cost catalysts that can drive the chemical reactions necessary to convert excess solar and wind energy into other fuels that may be used to generate electricity when other sources of renewable energy are unavailable. By developing AI to accurately predict atomic interactions faster than the compute-heavy simulations scientists rely on today, calculations that take modern laboratories days could instead take seconds. This would enable the large-scale exploration of new materials which is crucial when there are billions of possible combinations to test.

## Geothermal

We announced an agreement with Sage Geosystems to support the first deployment of next-generation geothermal power at scale east of the Rocky Mountains. This project — which will deliver up to 150 MW of new geothermal baseload power — will help significantly expand the use of geothermal power in the US and allows us to further diversify our portfolio with this clean, affordable, and resilient power source. Our commitment to long-term electricity purchases from burgeoning technologies like geothermal provides financial certainty to projects like this, helping them come to the grid faster.2025 Meta Sustainability Report

# Nuclear Energy

As new innovations bring impactful technological advancements across sectors and support economic growth, we believe that nuclear energy can help provide firm, baseload power to support the growth needs of the electric grids that power our data centers and the communities around them. We released a [request for proposal (RFP) to identify nuclear energy projects ↗](https://example.com/rfp) to help us meet our AI and sustainability objectives.

Our aim is to add one to four GW of new nuclear generation capacity in the US to be delivered starting in the early 2030s. We are seeking developers that can not only accelerate the availability of new nuclear generators but also scale sufficiently to reduce costs. We believe working with partners who will ultimately permit, design, engineer, finance, construct, and operate these power plants will ensure the long-term thinking necessary to accelerate nuclear technology.

In early 2025, Meta joined peers in pledging to support the goal of tripling global nuclear capacity by 2050. Facilitated by the [World Nuclear Association ↗](https://example.com/world-nuclear-association), this pledge signifies a global recognition of the role of nuclear energy in energy resilience and security.

# Clinton Clean Energy Center

In June 2025, Meta signed a 20-year PPA with [Constellation ↗](https://example.com/constellation) for the output of the Clinton Clean Energy Center to support our clean energy goals and operations in the region with 1,121 MW of emissions-free nuclear energy. The agreement will also expand Clinton’s clean energy output by 30 MW through plant uprates.

This agreement demonstrates the value of existing nuclear infrastructure, ensuring the Clinton Clean Energy Center will continue to operate for another two decades. It will preserve 1,100 high-paying local jobs, deliver $13.5 million in annual tax revenue and add $1 million in charitable giving to local nonprofits over five years.

# Construction Emissions

Addressing the emissions associated with the construction of our physical infrastructure means that we must identify lower carbon alternatives for the materials used in these structures.

<img>Aerial view of a large industrial complex with multiple buildings, roads, and surrounding landscape.</img>

# Material Selection

Based on an internal analysis of the near-, medium-, and long-term emissions reduction opportunities, our data center design, engineering, and construction teams have prioritized the most effective interventions to reduce emissions associated with construction.

This analysis helps inform strategic decisions and low carbon material identification to reduce emissions in ongoing and future data center construction.2025 Meta Sustainability Report
<page_number>23</page_number>

# Low Carbon Concrete

Concrete is integral to the data centers that bring our technologies and programs to life. We are piloting and deploying [concrete with significantly lower embodied carbon emissions](https://www.meta.com/). Adjusting the formula of inputs that constitute concrete — particularly by substituting cement with tried and tested alternatives such as fly ash and slag — can reduce the carbon footprint of this essential building material. We have incorporated low carbon concrete into specifications for our latest data center designs.

We are investing in novel technologies to further reduce concrete emissions at scale. We announced [an agreement with CarbonBuilt](https://www.meta.com/) to upgrade additional concrete masonry plants and scale production of its low carbon concrete. We are also providing carbon finance to [CarbiCrete to scale the production of cement-free concrete](https://www.meta.com/) with a number of concrete manufacturers.

With Infrastructure Masons and more than 70 companies, including the largest data center operators, we formed the [iMasons Climate Accord](https://www.meta.com/) to reduce carbon in digital infrastructure materials, products, and power. An independent governing body has been tasked with adopting or developing a standard methodology for measuring carbon in digital infrastructure. iMasons will help accelerate decarbonization across a sector with equally ambitious goals for both hyperscaling technology and addressing climate change. Through this collaborative effort, we have [called on concrete suppliers](https://www.meta.com/) to support greater transparency by providing Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) disclosing embodied carbon.

Finally, AI can accelerate the discovery of high-performing low carbon concrete. Manually optimizing concrete mixes for multiple attributes, like strength, cure time, and sustainability, can be challenging. To jointly maximize the performance and minimize the environmental impact of concrete, we developed an [open source AI model](https://www.meta.com/) that uses an innovative approach to optimize concrete mixtures. We further developed an AI pipeline with industry experts at [Amrize](https://www.meta.com), a major building systems solution company, and researchers at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://www.meta.com) to discover and test novel concrete mixes for data center usage. Just through the optimization of the mix proportions of conventional concrete materials, AI was able to generate a new formula that achieved a 40% carbon reduction compared against the industry baseline while showing superior curing speed and strength. The selected mix has been poured in our newest data centers, including in slab-on-grade applications that require stringent performance requirements for a data center building section at our Rosemount, Minnesota location.

<img>Mass Timber Building</img>

# Mass Timber

To reduce the emissions associated with data center construction, we have begun **piloting mass timber** in the construction of buildings on our data center campuses. Mass timber refers to a variety of wood-based products engineered for strength and durability, and act as substitutes for steel and other common building materials.

Our first mass timber administrative building was erected at our Aiken, South Carolina data center campus in 2025. Incorporating mass timber in the construction of administrative buildings like these will reduce the embodied carbon of the materials being substituted by approximately 41%. We will begin incorporating mass timber into additional administrative buildings, warehouses, and even data halls that house the servers that connect people to our technologies.

We require third-party audits to ensure wood is sourced and milled responsibly. These audits must demonstrate that wood can be transparently traced to the forest of origin, and these forests must be managed for long-term ecological health and social impact, including safe working conditions and fair wages for local communities.

# Low Carbon Metals

Metals used in our data centers, from copper wiring to structural steel beams, carry embodied carbon emissions from the moment metallurgical ores are mined to the time they are installed in our buildings. We are partnering with companies taking innovative approaches to reduce these emissions. This includes Southwire, a copper wire supplier, whose copper is produced with 100% renewable energy. We have begun using this copper in two of our data center locations. We also aim to incorporate near-zero-emissions steel in our construction and build the market for this steel through our membership in RMI’s Sustainable Steel Buyers Platform.

At another data center site under construction, we plan to partner with manufacturers who are matching energy use in the steel production process with 100% renewable energy to reduce emissions associated with structural steel.2025 Meta Sustainability Report
<page_number>25</page_number>

# Construction Site Electrification

We are working to reduce emissions from on-site construction activities by exploring electrification of construction equipment and increasing electric vehicle charging stations. In Altoona, Iowa, we have tested low-emission construction equipment, including solar hybrid lighting towers, temporary power generators with battery backup, and electric heaters. We are partnering with general contractors and equipment suppliers to thoroughly evaluate this equipment with a goal to eventually scale its use across our construction sites globally if it meets our performance criteria.

# Decarbonizing With Biofuel

Decarbonizing necessary emergency backup power generators is critical to reach our net zero target while keeping our data centers operational. Diesel consumption from backup power generation accounts for a considerable portion of the operational emissions from our data centers. We have studied the viability of replacing conventional diesel with renewable hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and have approved the use of this fuel at several data center locations. Our Clonee, Ireland site was the first site to transition to HVO and in early 2025 we expanded our use of HVO to five additional sites in North America. We have also started using HVO in construction equipment and vehicles where we are breaking ground on new data centers. This year, we will pilot the use of HVO in heavy duty earth works equipment to assess the feasibility of expanding the use of HVO across our construction projects.

# Shipping and Travel Emissions

While employees are encouraged to meet virtually when possible, we promote more sustainable travel practices when travel is necessary through internal resources for planning trips with a reduced carbon footprint. This includes notifications within our travel booking tool to inform employees of alternate routes or aircraft types with lower emissions.

# Sustainable Fuels

We are also supporting procurement for a number of alternative fuels that help us address emissions associated with employee travel and commute. We calculate emissions from individual trip segment-level data by incorporating information on the type of aircraft or specific hotel, thereby enabling a level of granularity to encourage improved decision making to reduce business travel emissions.

<img>Airplane flying in the sky</img>

## Aviation Fuel

Since 2021, Meta has purchased nearly 4 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) certificates. SAF is a drop-in fuel made with renewable or waste feedstocks that has up to an 80% lower carbon footprint than traditional jet fuel. The SAF we procure is certified by accredited third parties that independently verify that biofuel feedstocks are managed responsibly.

We are supporting efforts to drive market demand for SAF through our role as a founding member of the [Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA)](https://www.sustainableaviationbuyersalliance.org/). Over the next five years, SABA members have committed to purchase SAF certificates representing nearly 50 million gallons of high-integrity SAF, which is equivalent to approximately 500,000 tons of abated CO₂e. Through SABA and in direct coordination with our airline partners, Meta will continue to adopt SAF to help decrease the environmental footprint of business travel.<header>2025 Meta Sustainability Report</header>

## Employee Shuttles

At the end of 2024, we successfully piloted renewable diesel fuel in our Bay Area employee shuttle fleet, already saving an estimated 3,000 MT CO₂e. Looking ahead, we plan to deploy renewable diesel to our shuttle fleets in other locations.

---

## Maritime Fuel

In September 2023, Meta joined the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA). As a non-profit organization and initiative of Cargo Owners for Zero Emissions Vessels (coZEV), the mission of ZEMBA is to enable companies to access zero-emission shipping solutions that are not widely available.

In 2024, more than a dozen ZEMBA members, including Meta, collectively committed to purchase the environmental attributes associated with over 1 billion twenty-foot shipping container-miles of zero-emission shipping on a route from Singapore to Rotterdam, Netherlands in 2025 - 2026. This contract will avoid at least 82,000 MT of CO₂e by using Hapag-Lloyd’s independently certified, waste-based biomethane. In addition to participating in ZEMBA’s inaugural offtake, we also signed an offtake agreement for sustainable maritime fuel certificates with the Danish shipping company NORDEN.<header>2025 Meta Sustainability Report</header>
<page_number>28</page_number>

# Data Center and Network Hardware

Each of the hardware components in our data centers has an associated carbon footprint, and we are embracing circularity in our hardware practices to manage these emissions.

We are committed to minimizing waste and reducing upstream emissions in our data center and network hardware by applying materials reuse and recycling standards. This approach enables us to extend the life of individual components, such as dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs) in our server racks, which have been a focus since 2021. Additionally, we are working on harvesting and redeploying components that meet our reliability standards for both critical spares and integration into new racks.

When our hardware reaches its end-of-life, we collaborate closely with downstream partners to support responsible management of residual materials where possible. This includes recycling or finding secondary markets for parts outside of our data centers, thereby extending their lifespan and reducing electronic waste. This is a key part of supporting the responsible management of materials in the value chain, which includes safely handling residual materials, exploring the recovery of valuable materials for secondary uses, diverting waste sent to landfills, and promoting a circular economy.

## Prioritizing More Sustainable Materials

We prioritize the use of post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastics and recycled metal (e.g., copper, aluminum, and steel) in our data center IT hardware, such as server racks. We aim to reduce the embedded carbon in our server hardware and promote a more sustainable supply chain. We are also exploring lower carbon materials for packaging and lower carbon transportation modes to further reduce the value chain emissions.

## Expanding Circularity to Network Construction Efforts

Building on our experience in data center hardware circularity, we are now applying similar principles to the construction of our network and fiber infrastructure connecting our data centers across the world. We have conducted some of the first LCAs for fiber networks, which inform how to best incorporate low carbon construction materials and fuels to drive emissions reductions as we expand our network infrastructure.

<page_number>29</page_number>

# Consumer Hardware

We are focusing efforts to reduce emissions associated with our consumer hardware such as our Meta Quest and Ray-Ban Meta devices.

The following interventions contribute to reducing emissions from the manufacturing to shipping of each of our consumer hardware devices:

## Supplier Engagement

We are partnering with suppliers to help them procure clean energy for their facilities that support the manufacturing of Meta devices and their components. Through 2024, the team partnered with over 15 suppliers on our journey to shift the entire supply chain to leverage renewable energy.

## Packaging

We engineer packaging solutions that safeguard product integrity throughout its lifecycle, while prioritizing sustainability. Our approach involves minimizing waste, utilizing renewable materials, and designing for recyclability to drive circularity.

## Material Optimization

We design products with a focus on robustness, reliability, and sustainability, aiming to maximize lifespan while minimizing waste and emissions through optimized material selection and reduced weight.

## Transportation

We are working to transition to lower emission transportation modes such as ocean freight, which emits approximately 10% of the carbon emissions of air freight.

<page_number>30</page_number>

# Net Zero Supplier Engagement

The majority of our emissions are connected to our suppliers.

We have developed the Net Zero Supplier Engagement Program to support key suppliers to accelerate their efforts to reduce their emissions. By 2026, we aim to engage two-thirds of our suppliers, based on their contribution to our emissions, to set science-aligned GHG reduction targets. By the end of 2024, 48% of our suppliers, based on their contribution to our emissions, have set science-aligned emissions reduction targets.

We provide capacity building training ↗ to our suppliers on:

*   Calculating emissions.
*   Setting science-aligned emissions reduction targets.
*   Building and operationalizing decarbonization roadmaps.
*   Creating renewable energy procurement strategies.
*   Understanding renewable energy markets.

We also help suppliers identify actions to meet emissions reduction targets, leveraging supplier emissions data to discover high impact opportunities for reducing emissions and ensuring a clear plan is in place to achieve them.

In 2021, we started working with 39 key suppliers to calculate and report GHG emissions and identify reduction opportunities. The program expanded to 183 suppliers in 2024, representing over half of our supplier-contributed emissions. These suppliers come from sectors critical to our supply chain, including semiconductors and electronics, construction fiber, connectivity, and professional services.

To learn more about our commitment to safe, healthy, and fair working conditions for workers in our manufacturing supply chain, please visit our Responsible Supply Chain section.

# Focused Reductions

We take supplier-provided data and work with suppliers to focus emissions reductions in five main areas:

1.  Energy efficiency
2.  Clean and renewable energy
3.  Circularity
4.  Transportation
5.  Supplier engagement

**CASE STUDY**

## Clean Energy Procurement Academy (CEPA)

In 2023, Meta and five other leading corporations launched CEPA to support and accelerate suppliers’ renewable energy purchases and further the decarbonization of global supply chains. Starting in the Asia-Pacific region, the founding organizations pooled their expertise and internal training resources to design country-specific curricula to help trainees procure clean energy.

The Academy offers on-site learning experiences on foundational knowledge, latest procurement trends and policy updates, and immersive procurement exercises with the larger community. These workshops are led by experienced in-country partners and guest speakers. Additionally, the Academy provides virtual training through webinars and presentations throughout the year.2025 Meta Sustainability Report
<page_number>32</page_number>

# Value Chain Interventions

Our LCAs and supplier-reported emissions data have revealed that a significant portion of our emissions originate from multiple tiers upstream in our supply chain, often from commodities where emission tracing is challenging or unavailable. In these cases, investing in value chain emission reduction projects can help us achieve meaningful reductions, even when we lack full traceability of the exact source of emissions.

We actively pursue value chain interventions that can decarbonize our value chain at the pace and scale required to achieve our emissions reduction targets. We focus particularly within hard-to-abate sectors and where we are unable to attribute reductions to a specific value chain partner.

We believe that these interventions can catalyze the deployment of long-term, scalable solutions to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors and build the markets for products and solutions that Meta and our value chain partners can use directly to reduce emissions.

The success of contractual instruments and project-level investment in the voluntary renewable energy market serves as a powerful example of how this approach can drive system-level decarbonization. We believe that replicating these systems and markets for other decarbonization technologies can unlock scaled investment across sectors and countries, ultimately accelerating our transition to a low carbon economy.

<img>A semiconductor wafer being processed on a machine.</img>

Meta has launched request for proposals since 2024 for value chain interventions for emissions reduction, and this year we are focusing our RFP on the following sectors:

*   Semiconductor manufacturing
*   Chemicals manufacturing
*   Truck transportation
*   Copper mining and manufacturing
*   Steel and iron mining and manufacturing
*   Cement and concrete manufacturing
*   Space heating of commercial buildings
*   Addressing fugitive emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases in commercial settings
*   Air transportation
*   Aluminum production and processing
*   Maritime transportation<header>2025 Meta Sustainability Report</header>

# Removing Remaining Emissions

<img>A river flowing through a lush green landscape with rocky cliffs.</img>

While our climate strategy prioritizes emissions reduction, some residual emissions from hard-to-abate sectors will remain in 2030. Any residual emissions we cannot eliminate will require carbon removal projects to reach net zero emissions.

Our carbon removal strategy seeks to expand the voluntary carbon market toward projects that offer environmental and social benefits beyond carbon sequestration, as well as to drive new innovation.

## Natural and Technological Solutions

We believe we have an important role to play in advancing the development and accessibility of both natural and technological carbon removal solutions. Each project type offers different pathways to impact at scale, on both immediate and longer-term timelines.

Emerging technologies like direct air capture (DAC) offer a high global climate mitigation potential and will be a necessary complement to emissions reductions and nature-based carbon removals. Nature-based carbon removal via ecosystems like forests or soils is deployable now and can offer solutions to both mitigate climate change and address biodiversity loss. We prioritize ecological restoration as well as projects that directly benefit people’s lives and livelihoods, such as by increasing food security or providing additional sources of income. These types of projects are especially important for communities most affected by the impacts of climate change.2025 Meta Sustainability Report
<page_number>34</page_number>

# Symbiosis Coalition

The [Symbiosis Coalition ↗](https://www.symbiosiscoalition.org/) is an advance market commitment (AMC) which aims to send a strong demand signal to accelerate the development of up to 20 million tons of nature-based carbon removal credits by 2030. With members including Meta, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce, and McKinsey, the coalition conducted its [first RFP ↗](https://www.symbiosiscoalition.org/rfp) focused on reforestation and agroforestry projects. Finalists from this initial RFP will demonstrate the high bar for quality for next-generation nature restoration projects, with the aim to catalyze the development of similar projects in the future.

# National Indian Carbon Coalition

Through [1t.org ↗](https://1t.org/), the National Indian Carbon Coalition and Meta have pledged to promote a model for carbon removal projects that centers on the leadership, traditional ecological knowledge, and vision of Indigenous Peoples for themselves and the land they caretake. Through this partnership, we pledged to develop no fewer than three carbon removal credit generating projects that protect and restore forest lands through Indigenous, tribal, and community leadership. This year, we are happy to share progress of our partnership by contracting for our first batch of carbon credits with the Fon du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa community in Minnesota. This project will safeguard healthy native ecosystems on the Nagaajiwanaang Reservation while increasing access to natural resources for the Band.<header>2025 Meta Sustainability Report</header>

## Climate-Smart Forestry

Earlier this year, Meta announced a long-term contract with EFM, a forest investment and management firm, for the delivery of 676,000 nature-based carbon removal credits through 2035. The project is expected to support the transition of 68,000 acres of forestland to climate-smart management on Washington’s Olympic Peninsula.

EFM’s climate-smart approach diversifies the revenue streams from forests to include carbon credits and conservation easements alongside revenue from traditional forest products.

It allows forest management choices that rebuild timber stocks, produce higher-value logs, and deliver lasting climate, social, and ecological benefits, including salmon habitat restoration, recreational opportunities, non-timber products, tribal cultural harvesting, and enhanced carbon storage.

## Latin America Reforestation

Meta signed a long-term contract with BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group (TIG) for the delivery of 1.3 million nature-based carbon removal credits, with options for delivery of an additional 2.6 million credits through 2038. The credits will be delivered as part of BTG Pactual TIG’s $1 billion reforestation and restoration strategy, which focuses on the conservation, restoration, and planting of deforested and degraded properties in selected regions in Latin America. This includes the Cerrado biome in Brazil, one of the most biodiverse seasonally dry ecosystems in the world. Conservation International serves as Impact Advisor to ensure the strategy enhances biodiversity and supports inclusive and equitable community development.<header>2025 Meta Sustainability Report</header>
<page_number>36</page_number>

# Mapping the Earth’s Forests

Forests harbor most of Earth’s terrestrial biodiversity and play a critical role in the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

<img>World map with green areas indicating forest coverage.</img>

Ecosystem services provided by forests underpin an essential defense against the climate and biodiversity crises. However, critical gaps remain in the scientific understanding of the structure and extent of global forests, particularly in dynamic and more dispersed forest systems such as agroforestry, drylands forests, and alpine forests, which together constitute more than a third of the world’s forests. Higher resolution forest data has the potential to dramatically improve the monitoring of conservation and restoration efforts globally. This is important for both forest-based carbon credit projects and other conservation efforts focused on the preservation of forests.

We leveraged our DINOv2 AI training algorithm and collaborated with World Resources Institute (WRI) to launch an open source map of global tree canopy height at a 1-meter resolution, allowing the detection of individual trees. We hope this high resolution canopy height data can ultimately be applied to forest biomass and carbon stock monitoring. Remote sensing can make the monitoring and verification of carbon removal projects more efficient and more accessible, especially for smaller scale projects in communities or initiatives that have a higher barrier to participate in the carbon market.<header>2025 Meta Sustainability Report</header>
<page_number>37</page_number>

# Climate Risk and Resilience

We identify and assess actual (historic and current) and potential (future) climate-related transition and physical risks, opportunities, and financial impacts to our operations and value chain across multiple time horizons. Examples of transition risks we assess include reputational risk from perceived environmental impacts of global technology infrastructure and the potential for new global climate regulations that may lead to increased operational costs. Examples of physical risks we assess include climate-related extreme weather events, especially in the US where the majority of our data centers are located, causing disruptions that may lead to incremental data center operation costs and interruptions to our programs.

To manage any transition risks, we are working toward achieving our net zero and water positive goals, as outlined in these reports: Our Path to Net Zero ↗ and Our Approach to Water Restoration ↗.

## Managing Physical Risks

To manage physical risks, we have identified and deployed over 100 climate resilience measures. Some examples include:

### Incorporating Physical Climate Hazards in our Operational Playbooks

To ensure the safety of our personnel and the continuity of our operations, we create and maintain “playbooks” instructing teams on how to effectively respond to and manage emergency events that may occur at our data centers. These comprehensive guides detail the roles and responsibilities of various teams and the actions necessary to respond to climate-related hazards — such as floods, hurricanes, and wildfires — and eventually return to normal operations. They are crucial for maintaining operational continuity and safety and are regularly updated to adapt to new challenges and improve response strategies. Accordingly, Meta updated our internal Natural Event Response Playbook and Water Response and Readiness Playbook to incorporate insights from our most recent climate risk assessments to enhance site preparedness. Our climate risk assessments identify and assess potential historic, current, and future impacts from climate-related hazards to our global data center operations across different climate scenarios and time horizons. Incorporating their findings into our relevant playbooks helps enhance our plans not just for today, but for what we may expect in the future from a changing climate. During a crisis, these resources are easily accessible, and regular exercises ensure our staff are able to properly execute the necessary response.

# Launching a Tool to Avoid Employee Exposure to Extreme Heat

Meta developed and deployed a tool to mitigate personnel exposure to dangerous temperatures. Dashboards deployed across our US data center sites capture real-time heat index and employee exposure risk within industrial spaces. Incorporating outside ambient conditions to estimate the interior heat index, these predictive dashboards provide an hourly seven-day look ahead to assist site teams in work planning. In conjunction with the dashboards, a “Heat BOT” was developed using dynamic data points to notify workers upon entry into data halls of the current temperatures and whether conditions change while they remain badged into that space. The Heat BOT enables workers to take action according to our internal thermal stress guidance. For example, depending on the temperature, employees may need to implement a work rest regimen, apply cooling personal protective equipment, or stop work altogether. The Heat BOT has enabled teams to effectively manage work during higher heat conditions, enhancing the ability to maintain operations while keeping workers safe.

# Reducing Wildfire Risk with Prescribed Burns

Conducting prescribed burns at our data center locations can be an effective strategy for managing and reducing the risk of wildfires, while also promoting ecosystem health and biodiversity. By clearing out flammable vegetation and debris, prescribed burns can create a fire break of reduced fuels and healthy plants that helps protect data center infrastructure from potential wildfires. Additionally, prescribed burns can promote ecosystem resilience, support native plant and animal species, and improve soil health.

This proactive approach can also contribute to broader climate-related benefits, such as sequestering carbon in restored ecosystems and reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfires that release large amounts of GHGs. By incorporating prescribed burns into our data center land management strategies, we can help safeguard our assets while also supporting environmentally sustainable practices.<header>2025 Meta Sustainability Report</header>
<page_number>39</page_number>

## Engaging Partners to Establish Business- Relevant Climate Resilience Frameworks

We are partnering with the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES) and Resilience First to co-design and implement the Corporate Climate Resilience Pathways Initiative, a multiyear initiative to establish a robust business framework that enables companies to build climate resilience, disclose corporate actions, and track leadership and impact. In addition, we partnered with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to inform the development of The Business Leaders’ Guide to Climate Adaptation & Resilience, a guide that supports senior decision-makers and their functional teams to integrate climate adaptation and resilience into organizational strategy, governance, and operations.

## Internal Carbon Price Pilot

In 2024, we piloted an internal carbon price concept to drive internal awareness of emissions and to incorporate the cost of carbon into our decision making. We piloted the concept in five test cases and used a shadow price per ton to accelerate action toward our net zero goal.

The pilot helped us improve our emissions data and better understand the financial implications of those emissions. First, teams accelerated their adoption of product-level emissions factors instead of estimated emissions factors to calculate the emissions they are responsible for managing. Second, teams added the expected costs of emissions into the total cost of products and services and surfaced those carbon costs into the financials of ongoing management reviews. By integrating emissions into our business management processes, this accelerated the maturity of our emissions reduction program.

This pilot also provided valuable insights into the limitations of carbon pricing. The cost of carbon was generally a very small proportion of total costs and a shadow price also did not create a direct incentive to drive new decision-making.

As a result, we are not currently planning to use a carbon price more broadly and will continue to refine our approach, exploring more ways to effectively integrate the cost of emissions into our business processes.<header>2025 Meta Sustainability Report</header>

# Offices

Meta publicly reports on the carbon footprint of our global offices.

Each year we compare our actual emissions to our annual benchmarks to ensure that we are making progress toward our 2030 goals. We are targeting a 50% reduction in office carbon emissions in 2030 (from a 2019 baseline), which we aim to achieve through the following reduction goals:

*   ↓ **32%**  
    in office energy consumption
*   ↓ **50%**  
    in waste generated by office operations
*   ↓ **35%**  
    in employee commute emissions
*   ↓ **40%**  
    in embodied carbon of building materials and furniture
*   ↓ **54%**  
    in carbon intensity of culinary offerings

We design for resource efficiency across our global offices and require third-party sustainable building program certification from our largest offices globally. All Meta offices over 100,000 square feet are required to be LEED Gold or higher, and some offices also adhere to Fitwel, GreenStar, ISO 50001, and WELL standards. Our facilities teams monitor building resource consumption trends and prioritize performance optimizations to ensure energy and water efficiency.

# Dublin Office Operationalizes Sustainability

Our Dublin office continues its focus on sustainability and biodiversity, making changes to cleaning, landscaping, and waste management practices.

The office’s cleaning team replaced chemical-based products with a system that uses ionized water, reducing reliance on harmful substances and single-use plastic. This shift has eliminated the use of approximately 24,800 liters (L) of chemicals and saved over 1,420 kilograms (kg) of plastic packaging.

Compactors introduced for general waste and dry mixed recycling have helped reduce both waste volume and transport frequency. Where 10 collections per week were the previous norm, the office now only requires two collections each month. In parallel, dedicated recycling streams ensure waste is sorted and collected separately by material type, including dedicated recycling and recovery for cans.

The Dublin team collects coffee grounds from office machines, which are then used as compost across campus plantings. Finally, the office maintains five active beehives, supporting local biodiversity through pollinator-friendly landscaping. The latest honey harvest yielded 75 kg, equivalent to 300 jars.

# Water

<img>A person in a boat at sunset, with a tree on the right.</img>

<img>Water drop icon</img>

Water is a vital resource for life on earth, and we strive to connect its management to technical expertise and responsibility that help ensure healthy aquatic ecosystems.

In 2021, we announced our goal to be water positive in 2030. This means that Meta will return more water than we consume in our operations through water restoration initiatives that address shared water challenges and support water stewardship in the watersheds where we operate. At the watershed level, we aim to restore 200% of consumption in high water stress regions and 100% of consumption in medium water stress regions.

Because our data centers are responsible for the bulk of our water use, reducing our data center water consumption and being more efficient in our data center operations will be key to reaching our water positive goal. We also recognize that to balance our operational water use, we need to strategically support water restoration projects in some of the more water-stressed watersheds where we operate data centers.

# Water Stewardship

Minimizing water use, being transparent with our water data, and restoring water in water-stressed regions are key pillars of our water stewardship program.

## Minimizing Water Use

The bulk of water consumption in data centers is attributed to the management of air flow and cooling of the server halls. This involves managing temperature and humidity levels to ensure optimal performance and longevity of the IT equipment. Cooling the servers is crucial due to the heat they generate. Humidity control prevents equipment damage, electrostatic issues, and corrosion, and supports efficient cooling and a comfortable working environment.

Our data centers strive to minimize water use and prioritize on-site water efficiency in a number of ways, including:

*   Optimizing for water efficiency in data centers.
*   Landscaping with native and/or drought-resistant vegetation.
*   Completing water budgeting and flow meter audits.
*   Incorporating water-saving fixtures and technologies within data center facilities.

<img>A close-up view of a data center cooling system with white pipes, valves, and blue hoses.</img>

## Long-Term Resilience Measures

We leverage digital twin models of our data center cooling systems to generate accurate estimates of short- and long-term water usage under current and projected operating conditions. These virtual representations of our systems allow us to take a detailed, data-driven approach to our capacity planning, compliance monitoring, and water efficiency project prioritization.2025 Meta Sustainability Report
<page_number>51</page_number>

# Transparency

We share progress toward our 2030 water positive goal and our water use in our annual sustainability report. We also publish detailed information on each of our water restoration projects in our annual [Volumetric Water Benefits Report ↗](https://example.com/volumetric-water-benefits-report). Detailed information on how we calculate these values and assess water risk can be found [here ↗](https://example.com/how-we-calculate-values-and-assess-water-risk). We will also continue to publicly share aspects of our data center cooling technological and efficiency advancements through the [Open Compute Project ↗](https://example.com/open-compute-project).

<img>A serene beach scene with clear blue water and white sand.</img>

# Water Restoration

As we work toward achieving our water positive goal, we are investing in water conservation and restoration projects that:

*   Restore local habitats that promote biodiversity and keep water in-stream.
*   Boost water supply and reliability.
*   Enhance water quality.
*   Provide safe drinking water.

In 2024, we published a comprehensive report on our [water restoration approach ↗](https://example.com/water-restoration-approach), detailing our progress, guiding principles, and key definitions. Since 2017, we have funded more than 40 water restoration projects in nine watersheds. In 2024 alone, these operational restoration projects returned over 1.59 billion gallons of water to high and medium water stress regions. Once all projects are fully implemented, they are expected to restore 2.9 to 3.4 billion gallons of water annually.

Our contributions to the sustainability of a watershed go beyond volumetric benefits and include capacity-building components for leading organizations in the watersheds where we operate. These projects could include supporting local environmental nonprofits, governance, research, and other non-volume-generating activities.<header>2025 Meta Sustainability Report</header>

<img>N-Drip Irrigation Conversion in the Platte River Basin, Nebraska</img>

## N-Drip Irrigation Conversion in the Platte River Basin, Nebraska

The N-Drip Irrigation Conversion project in the Platte River Basin, Nebraska, focuses on enhancing water stewardship by converting 100 acres of cropland from traditional flood irrigation to advanced N-Drip precision drip irrigation systems. This transition aims to significantly reduce water withdrawals from the basin while maintaining crop yields, addressing the challenges posed by climate change-driven water scarcity, and increasing agricultural demand. By delivering water directly to crop root zones with real-time soil moisture management, the project minimizes evaporation and runoff, improving irrigation efficiency and supporting more sustainable agricultural practices. The initiative includes installation of sensors and smart irrigation management technology to optimize water use and provide detailed annual water savings reports.

Investing in this project exemplifies our commitment to climate adaptation, water conservation, and agricultural resilience, contributing an estimated volumetric water benefit of 65.5 million gallons annually over 10 years, while fostering collaboration with local technical partners and farmers to ensure long-term ecosystem and community benefits.

## Peatland Restoration in Liffey River Basin, Wicklow Mountains, Ireland

The Peatland Restoration project in the Wicklow Mountains Special Area of Conservation aims to restore 450 hectares of degraded blanket bogs, enhancing water storage capacity, protecting existing carbon stocks, reducing emissions, and increasing carbon sequestration potential. Located just south of Dublin, this ecologically vital upland habitat has suffered from drainage, peat extraction, fires, and overgrazing, leading to significant degradation and increased vulnerability to climate impacts. Through active rewetting techniques such as peat dams and coir bunding, the project will rehabilitate the peatland ecosystem, supporting biodiversity, improving water quality, and mitigating wildfire risks. Investing in this initiative exemplifies a strong commitment to climate action and ecosystem resilience by preserving critical carbon-rich habitats and fostering sustainable land management in collaboration with local partners and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. The project is expected to deliver volumetric water benefits of 21 to 43 million gallons annually over a 10-year period, contributing to long-term environmental and community benefits.<header>2025 Meta Sustainability Report</header>

# Framework for Supplier Standards and Risk Assessments

We are committed to improving the working conditions and sustained performance of our manufacturing supply chain.

We use a risk-based methodology to regularly assess suppliers’ social and environmental risks, then engage with them to build their capabilities to meet expectations at Meta. We assess suppliers’ conformance to the RBA Code of Conduct ↗ and other Responsible Supply Chain policies and standards via independent third-party audits, supplier questionnaires, and other types of on-site assessments.

We rely on the RBA’s Validated Assessment Program (VAP) Standard for onsite compliance verification against the RBA Code of Conduct. For audits completed in 2024, the most common audit findings were related to working hours and management systems control processes for labor topics, which are categorized under the “Labor” section of the RBA Code of Conduct.

The chart below shows the percentage of nonconformance findings across the RBA Code of Conduct section. We work with suppliers to understand root causes, develop corrective action plans, and assess closure for any identified areas of concern.

# Building Business Value

Integrating sustainability criteria into supplier performance management helps manage labor, health and safety, human rights, and environmental risks and holds suppliers accountable for their performance on these metrics.

When suppliers demonstrate strong management of responsible supply chain topics, it helps to mitigate risks to business, further supporting growth. In 2024, several suppliers with strong systems in place for managing labor standards and environmental compliance in their supply chains were given recognition for their efforts during supplier business reviews with cross-functional teams and senior management.

<img>Image of multiple trucks parked at a loading dock.</img>

## CASE STUDY

### Integrating Supplier Responsibility Into Sourcing Practices

Supplier performance management is used to review the business performance between Meta and selected Meta suppliers led by sourcing teams and cross-functional partners. Meta and suppliers submit their own reviews for supplier performance results and meet to discuss results.

The Responsible Supply Chain team contributes to Supplier Business Reviews for data center and Reality Lab manufacturing suppliers. The scoring for sustainability is meant to highlight major accomplishments, dive deep into critical issues, and track progress on action items. The goal is that suppliers with strong performance and compliance on these topics are recognized.<header>2025 Meta Sustainability Report</header>

# Worker Resilience

Our worker well-being program is designed to support the safe working conditions and sustained performance of our manufacturing supply chain by keeping worker well-being at the core of what we do. In 2024, we reached more than 60,000 manufacturing workers through capacity building initiatives to build knowledge, skills, and management systems on human rights and environmental compliance topics. Each year we identify a subset of strategic supplier sites for inclusion in our focused initiatives on worker well-being. At these strategic supplier sites, we deploy worker surveys, provide resources to strengthen grievance mechanisms and support capacity-building programs, and conduct other worker engagement activities to understand workers’ needs and perspectives. Survey results inform supplier management teams on how to shape action plans to address root cause issues and further support workers. Investing in suppliers’ worker satisfaction and working conditions is important for our long-term success and further bolsters worker resilience in the face of change. We will continue to measure the impact of these programs via our worker surveys and apply lessons learned as we further develop the program.

## CASE STUDY

### Worker Voice

In 2024, we doubled the number of strategic supplier sites that participated in worker surveys compared to 2023. Worker surveys provide an anonymous channel for workers to express their sentiment on job satisfaction and overall well-being. The results of the survey help factory leadership better understand workers’ opinions and needs. They also drive improved supplier operational or performance metrics by supporting worker retention, improved health and safety, and better performance and efficiency, leading to improved social impact. Based on the surveys, we further supported a pilot to test a digital tool for supplier employees to report issues and anonymously submit feedback to their management on specific topics and issues related to working conditions.

# Fostering Respectful Workplaces

Our Responsible Supply Chain standards and policies are built on international standards.

The Respectful Workplace program at Meta gives suppliers the tools, knowledge, and skills to build up their management systems to prevent and address potential workplace safety issues.

In 2024, Meta worked with a strategic supplier to identify improvement opportunities to strengthen worker-management relationships and workplace communications. We worked with the supplier’s business, human resources, and training departments to launch a Respectful Workplace Training Program to build capabilities through peer and management coaching.

<img>A group of workers in hard hats and safety vests.</img>

We have deployed these trainings in several countries. We also offer a voluntary online training to Meta employees on best practices in building a safe and respectful workplace in supply chains.

## CASE STUDY

### Happiness Series

Launched in 2020, our Happiness Series initiative aims to elevate worker well-being and sense of community by focusing on employee voice and impact. Our first project co-designed with a supplier in 2021 was a “smart” library which expanded access to books and resources for workers. The following year, we supported a reading competition and talent show for families.

In 2023, we conducted a Worker Satisfaction Survey to gather valuable feedback and insights from workers, which identified potential ways to further drive positive changes. In 2024, Meta partnered with a supplier team to co-design a program that provided well-being activities for their employees. The 2024 program included providing treats and tea to workers in the summer season and supporting a gym room as a dedicated space for workers to engage in health and wellness activities with their community.2025 Meta Sustainability Report
<page_number>60</page_number>

# Responsible Factory Initiative

In 2024, we doubled the number of supplier sites participating in the RBA’s Responsible Factory Initiative to build knowledge, skills, and management systems on human rights and environmental compliance topics.

Suppliers completed self-assessments, participated in specialized assessment visits and training, and developed corrective action plans to address priority issues related to health and safety and emergency preparedness. After completing this program, suppliers demonstrated RSC performance and RBA Code compliance improvements.

In 2024, we:
* Used surveying and data collection tools to evaluate the use of process chemicals by key supplier sites and assess their policies and procedures to protect worker safety.
* Delivered training webinars to suppliers to support awareness raising and risk mitigation for safe process chemical use.
* Completed chemical management assessments (CMA) and broader EHS assessments at priority suppliers which helped identify and resolve non-conformances.
* Participated in industry working groups to understand requirements for industry initiatives to support a harmonized due diligence approach on identifying, assessing, and addressing chemical management risks throughout the electronics production supply chain.

## Process Chemical Program

Protecting workers from environmental, health, and safety risks is a key part of our RSC mission and the RBA Code of Conduct. Our Materials of Concern Standard supports safe and healthy environments for anyone who manufactures or uses Meta products.

We continue advancing our work to reduce worker exposure to hazardous chemicals by supporting safe process chemical management at supplier sites, utilizing the RBA Industry Focus Process Chemicals (IFPC) Policy as a foundation. Our Supplier IFPC Engagement Strategy supports supplier conformance to IFPC requirements, builds the capacity of suppliers to safely manage process chemicals, and encourages their use of safer alternatives.

Safeguarding workers’ health and the environment is critically important. Leveraging industry tools and best practices helps Meta address capacity-building needs, efficiently strengthen and scale the reach of our process chemical program, and support risk mitigation.<header>2025 Meta Sustainability Report</header>

<img>Icon of a hand holding a leaf.</img>

We are committed to supporting biodiversity at our data center properties.

Since 2023, our standard data center design dedicates the vast majority of unbuilt outdoor spaces to restore native habitat and largely eliminates turf and exotic ornamental species. By 2024, the focus on preservation and restoration practices was programatically connected to each step of data center development: diligence, planning, design, construction, and operation. Meta is committed to playing a positive role and investing in the long-term vitality of the communities in which we operate our data centers.

# Planning to Preserve Biodiversity

<img>A field of wildflowers with rolling hills in the background.</img>

During site diligence, qualified local native habitat experts assess our acquired properties through a standardized, science-based evaluation that is adapted from, and tracks to, emerging biodiversity reporting metrics.<sup>5</sup>

We design our data center campuses to largely avoid sensitive ecosystems, instead focusing on restoration and enhancement that complements the natural surroundings and regional character. Acquired properties that may have been degraded by previous uses are targeted for uplift and restoration, and areas disturbed by construction activities are integrated into each campus’s biodiversity plan.

Over 50% of our owned operational data center campus footprint — more than 4,000 acres — was planned, installed, or preserved to support local habitats with native species. In 2024, we continued to increase this footprint, incrementally adding additional acreage of biodiverse landscape to our portfolio with each new campus. With our new assessment tools, more granular data describing the restoration successes at our campuses will become available, allowing us to identify areas for maintenance or additional enhancement.

# Meta Campus Biodiversity Projects

In addition to the implementation of a comprehensive biodiversity-focused program across our data centers, this year we also piloted unique land management and special restoration projects across our portfolio.

The following special projects, management tools, and creative nature-based solutions are a few examples that highlight our intent to protect and restore more land than we impact.

## Oregon

Our first data center in Prineville, Oregon — and our first native habitat restoration project — began in 2010. Targeting the restoration of 200+ acres of arid, native Sagebrush Steppe landscape marked a significant deviation from typical turf-gravel industrial landscapes and an immense cross-functional partnership. Landscape architects, city officials, and engineering teams collaborated to envision and bring to life this unique approach.

Patient and informed responses continually evolved the design to keep costs down, find plants and the expertise to plant them, and balance native plant establishment with weed control and temporary irrigation water use efficiencies. In addition to seeding throughout the campus, we planted over 170,000 native plant plugs along visible roadways and paths, providing both beauty and a diverse local seed bank. We also partnered with local ranchers to use sheep and goats to help control or eradicate invasive cheatgrass infestations. The Prineville landscape supports 20 beehives placed and managed by a local beekeeper.

# Alabama

A Black Belt Prairie restoration garden and seed processing facility at our Montgomery data center campus will allow us to produce, harvest, and plant our own diverse mix of locally native seeds and help restore this endangered ecosystem. Our 1,500 acre property was around 95% exotic grass upon purchase. Black Belt Prairie ecosystems are known to produce hundreds of different grass and pollinator plant species throughout the year, in turn providing food and habitat for a network of insects, birds, and other animals. Our restoration project at this campus will increase the amount of Black Belt Prairie habitat in the world, of which only 1 – 3%⁶ remains.

We collected the biodiverse seed mix sustainably from a wild remnant of this prairie, with permission from a local private landowner. The seeds were cleaned, dried, and stored in our onsite processing facility to be planted in our 10-acre onsite restoration garden.

Instead of maintaining turf at this data center, we will plant Black Belt Prairie seeds on any areas disturbed during construction. We have also partnered with a local grower to farm non-built areas, a common restoration approach for weed control to prepare large areas for incremental transition to prairie. We hope our restoration garden will continuously serve as a source plot, supplying the seeds for campus restoration.

# South Carolina

Before breaking ground at our Aiken campus, we partnered with the South Carolina State Forestry Commission to perform a prescribed burn over 400 acres. The project was a cost- and nature-effective way to protect sensitive soils and promote native plant species by reducing weed competition, recycling nutrients, building soil, controlling pests, and reducing risk of wildfire. While prescribed burning is a common landscape tool used throughout the world, after this successful pilot we have deployed prescribed burns as a tool at several other locations and have embedded this tool into our land management program as a standard option for native habitat restoration and responsible land stewardship. Read more about prescribed burns in the [climate risk and resilience section](climate risk and resilience section).

# Utah

After three failed attempts to grow grass and other plants at our Eagle Mountain data center, we adjusted our approach. Soil testing revealed extremely high levels of salt. As construction progressed in other areas of the campus, a local habitat restoration expert established onsite test plots to study the use of soil restoration amendments and paired appropriate plant species with site conditions. The results of this adaptive, nature-based solution included using a greenhouse to grow 34,000 native plant plugs that are ready as each area is targeted for completion and an innovation for mechanized plug installation across large commercial sites. Success at this data center required patience, but we are confident our approach will yield another 240 acres of restored Sagebrush Steppe ecosystem.

# Community Biodiversity Projects

In partnership with the Tennessee Environmental Council and Sumner County Schools, Meta provided support for the installation of 6,000 square feet of pollinator gardens in six schools near our Gallatin data center, offering students hands-on opportunities to learn about sustainable practices and environmental conservation.

Near our Mesa data center, we partnered with the Arizona Sustainability Alliance, the City of Mesa, Valley Metro, local high school student Environmental Club volunteers, and the Mayor and Councilmembers to plant several hundred native, low-water-use trees, plants, and shrubs at the Superstition Springs Transit Center. This regional commuter hub handles hundreds of daily passengers from the East Valley. This project helped bring awareness to the use and benefits of native plants and the value of biodiverse “pocket parks” to urban ecosystems.

Meta helped fund the Lotus Marsh Boardwalk at the Fort Worth Nature Center and Refuge near our Fort Worth data center. The City of Fort Worth and Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s investment in the hiking trails, resident bison herd, prairie dog colony, marsh boardwalk, and the Hardwicke Interpretive Center provides more than 63,000 visitors each year with the opportunity to experience nature in their community.

# Preventing Wildlife Trafficking

We aim to combat illegal wildlife trafficking across our platforms and are part of the Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online ↗. The coalition brings together tech companies and wildlife experts at World Wildlife Fund ↗, TRAFFIC ↗, and International Fund for Animal Welfare ↗. The coalition’s aim is to end the trafficking of wildlife parts and products across online platforms that have eased the exchange of products between poachers and buyers. We regularly collaborate with our conservation partners to better understand the data and methods in which illegal wildlife trade might be facilitated across our technologies. In addition, we actively monitor endangered species content per our Community Standards and maintain ongoing enforcement in this space.<header>2025 Meta Sustainability Report</header>

# Connecting Subsea Digital Infrastructure Sustainably

Submarine cable systems — or subsea cables — are the backbone of global digital infrastructure, accounting for more than **95% of intercontinental traffic** across the world’s oceans enabling communication.

We aim to prioritize environmental protection during the installation and operation of our subsea cable systems and leverage industry-leading practices, including:

*   Seafloor mapping to identify and avoid ecologically sensitive areas.
*   Selecting cable routes that aim to avoid protected areas, to the greatest extent practicable, including critical breeding and feeding grounds for vulnerable species.
*   Using more sustainable manufacturing materials, which do not leach harmful substances into the ecosystem.
*   Partnering with marine scientists, regulatory bodies, local authorities, and community leaders to evaluate and reduce environmental impact.
*   Engineering and route optimization to minimize the spatial footprint of cables.
*   Leveraging monitoring devices and sensors to provide ongoing data collection for oceanographic research and hazard detection.
*   Meeting the requirements of international protocols, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and environmental standards set by ICPC and UNEP-WCMC.
