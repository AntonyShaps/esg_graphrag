We are living in a historic time. The era of
AI has arrived—and with it, a new industrial
revolution. The shift from general-purpose
computing to AI is transforming every
industry, every scientific field, and daily life.

AI is more than a technological shift—it’s
the birth of an entirely new manufacturing
industry, bringing profound economic and
societal opportunities. Today’s data centers,
built for general-purpose computing,
don’t have the performance or efficiency
to support AI. Modernizing more than $1
trillion of data centers is now underway.

At the center of this transformation

is the AI factory—where electricity

goes in and tokens come out. Data
is transformed into intelligence, and

intelligence drives the new economy.

Traditional manufacturing runs on
100-megawatt factories. But this new

industry—AI manufacturing—is something
else entirely. Each one is a $60 billion

investment. It takes three years to build
and requires a vast new workforce.

We’ll need carpenters, steelworkers, masons,

mechanical and electrical engineers, and

plumbers—the tradecraft that will power
this new economy. Then come the experts
in computing, networking, and operations.

At the next layer, AI agents will transform
knowledge work—assisting doctors, financial
service professionals, and customer care
teams. At NVIDIA, every software engineer
is now assisted by AI. The amount of
code we produce is extraordinary. Our
productivity has increased dramatically—
alongside our ability to invest in new ideas
and invent more of what the world needs.

Energy Is the Limiter

Electricity is the lifeblood of digital
intelligence. We need more.

We must build AI factories for this industry
to thrive. However, supplying them with the

electricity they will need isn’t sustainable
with today’s energy infrastructure.

The solution is twofold. First, we need a
national, industry-focused energy policy

supporting this new industry’s growth. A single
AI factory can draw 100 to 200 megawatts—
on par with the world’s largest data centers.

These systems are being built continuously
across industries and nations. We appreciate
the current administration’s leadership
here and will contribute however we can.

But in an economy where electricity creates
intelligence—and intelligence drives revenue—
removing the energy bottleneck isn’t enough.

We must design AI factories where
extreme performance and energy
efficiency aren’t a tradeoff.

A New Computing Platform for a
New Era

We began building toward this future
over a decade ago, reinventing the entire

computing stack—from GPU architecture
and system design to libraries, developer

tools, and software platforms tailored for
specific industries. Today, NVIDIA is a full-

stack AI company, with more than 6 million
developers building AI applications that

discover life-saving drugs, design climate
models, and optimize global supply chains.

Our Blackwell architecture marked a

breakthrough moment in computing. In its
first quarter, Blackwell became the fastest-

ramping product in our history. It is the

engine of the AI factory—and the solution
to the data center energy bottlenecks.

Our Blackwell platform delivers a 25x
improvement in energy efficiency for
LLM inference compared to the Hopper
generation. It’s not just faster—it’s
fundamentally more efficient.

Accelerated computing is 20x more energy
efficient than traditional computing across
a mix of AI workloads. With revolutionary
density, a liquid-cooled rack now holds
a 1 exaflop system powered by 600,000
components working as one. Blackwell’s
performance-per-watt and density unlock
intelligence production at industrial scale.

NVIDIA is investing in U.S. manufacturing,

building AI supercomputers for the first

time in the U.S. Working with TSMC,
Foxconn, Wistron, Amkor, and SPIL, NVIDIA

plans to produce up to $500 billion worth
of AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the

next four years—strengthening supply
chain resilience and creating hundreds

of thousands of American jobs.

With this AI infrastructure in place,

we’ll help revolutionize every other
industry, and ultimately create new
ones we’ve yet to imagine.

Transforming Healthcare and Life
Sciences with AI

AI is transforming healthcare—from diagnosis
to precision treatment—and helping
accelerate the discovery of life-saving drugs.

Our AI platforms are driving breakthroughs
in precision drug discovery with partners
like Genentech and Amgen, and
powering intelligent surgical platforms
with Johnson & Johnson MedTech.

About NVIDIA

NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to
help solve the most challenging computational
problems. Today, we’re a full-stack computing
infrastructure company with data-center-
scale offerings that are reshaping industry.

Our full-stack includes the foundational
NVIDIA® CUDA® programming model that runs
on all NVIDIA GPUs, as well as hundreds of
domain-specific software libraries, software
development kits (SDKs), and Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs). This deep
and broad software stack accelerates the
performance and eases the deployment
of NVIDIA accelerated computing for
computationally intensive workloads such
as artificial intelligence (AI), model training
and inference, data analytics, scientific
computing, and 3D graphics. It delivers

vertical-specific optimizations to address
industries ranging from healthcare and

telecom to automotive and manufacturing.

Our data-center-scale offerings are comprised
of compute and networking solutions

that can scale to tens of thousands of
GPU-accelerated servers interconnected
to function as a single giant computer.
This type of data center architecture and
scale is needed for the development and
deployment of modern AI applications.

The GPU was initially used to simulate human

imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of
video games and films. Today, it also simulates
human intelligence, enabling a deeper
understanding of the physical world. Its
parallel processing capabilities, supported by
thousands of computing cores, are essential
for deep learning algorithms. This form of AI,
in which software writes itself by learning from
large amounts of data, can serve as the brain
of computers, robots, and self-driving cars
that can perceive and understand the world.
GPU-powered AI solutions are being developed
by thousands of enterprises to deliver services
and products that would have been immensely
difficult or even impossible with traditional
coding. Examples include generative AI, which
can create new content such as text, code,

images, audio, video, molecule structures, and
recommendation systems. These systems

can recommend highly relevant content
such as products, services, media, or ads

using deep neural networks trained on vast
datasets that capture the user’s preferences.

NVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing
together hardware, systems, software,

algorithms, libraries, and services to create
unique value for the markets we serve. While
the computing requirements of these end
markets are diverse, we address them with
a unified underlying architecture leveraging

our GPUs and networking and software
stacks. The programmable nature of our
architecture allows us to support several
multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same
underlying technology by using a variety of
software stacks developed either internally
or by third-party developers and partners.
The large and growing number of developers

and installed base across our platforms

strengthens our ecosystem and increases
the value of our platform to our customers.

Innovation is at our core. We have invested
over $58.2 billion in research and development

since our inception, yielding inventions
that are essential to modern computing.

Our invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked
the growth of the PC gaming market and
redefined computer graphics. With our
introduction of the CUDA programming model
in 2006, we opened the parallel processing

capabilities of our GPU to a broad range

of compute-intensive applications, paving
the way for the emergence of modern AI. In
2012, the AlexNet neural network, trained on
NVIDIA GPUs, won the ImageNet computer
image recognition competition, marking the
“Big Bang” moment of AI. We introduced
our first Tensor Core GPU in 2017, built from
the ground-up for the new era of AI, and our
first autonomous driving system-on-chips,
or SoC, in 2018. Our acquisition of Mellanox
in 2020 expanded our innovation canvas to
include networking, enabled our platforms
to be data center scale, and led to the
introduction of a new processor class—the
data processing unit, or DPU. Over the past
five years, we’ve built full software stacks that
run on top of our GPUs and CUDA to bring

AI to the world’s largest industries, including
the NVIDIA DRIVE™ stack for autonomous
driving, NVIDIA Clara™ for healthcare, and
NVIDIA Omniverse™ for industrial digitalization;
and introduced the NVIDIA AI Enterprise
software—essentially an operating system

for enterprise AI applications. In 2023,
we introduced our first data center CPU,
NVIDIA Grace™, built for giant-scale AI and
high performance computing, or HPC.

NVIDIA’s sustainability reporting follows our

fiscal calendar; FY25 data corresponds to the
period January 29, 2024, to January 26, 2025.

Product Energy Efficiency

Improving performance and energy efficiency
is a principal goal in each step of our research,
development, and design processes. We
develop hardware, software, and networking
technology to improve performance and
energy efficiency, helping our customers solve
problems and decrease emissions intensity.

Frontier AI models continue to increase in
complexity and size as they enhance generative
AI and enable scientific discoveries, and modern
data centers require accelerated computing
platforms to effectively execute these
workloads. Accelerated computing is the use

of specialized hardware to dramatically speed

up computation by parallel processing that
bundles frequently occurring tasks. It offloads

demanding work that can bog down traditional
processors that typically execute tasks in serial

fashion, and offers lower overall costs, higher
performance, and greater energy efficiency.

Acceleration completes larger workloads
more quickly, returning the computer to
a low-power idle state when done and
consuming significantly less energy overall
when compared to traditional computing.

Reducing energy and emissions per
computation represents NVIDIA’s biggest
opportunity to reduce emissions and
to support global sustainability efforts.
Our scope 3 target is measured in
PFLOP, or PetaFLOP, which represents
one quadrillion (10^15) floating-point
operations per second. This is a common
industry standard for measuring
computational performance capacity.

We plan to publish our FY26 progress

Energy and Environment

We’re committed to reducing our environmental
impact by driving operational excellence. We
identify and control environmental impacts and
continuously improve our performance using

a comprehensive environmental management
system (EMS) certified to ISO 14001, which

covers our Santa Clara, CA headquarters
buildings and Yokneam, Israel offices. Our

Environmental, Health, Safety, and Energy
Policy provides the framework for our EMS.

And our dedicated Environmental, Health,
and Safety and corporate sustainability
teams work closely with employees globally
to execute our environmental policies and
practices, with actionable goals and metrics
that are annually reviewed with executives.

managing energy efficiency at several of
our key data center locations, we have an
energy management system certified to
the ISO 50001 standard, which covered
approximately 41% of our data center
energy use in FY25. Our certification to
the ISO 50001 standard recognizes our
efforts to properly measure and reduce
energy consumption in our data centers.

Energy-Efficient Operations

Two of our headquarters buildings in
Santa Clara, CA, and our Hyderabad, India
campus are LEED Gold certified. These
buildings were designed to be energy and
water efficient, built with sustainable raw
materials and improved indoor environmental
quality. For our Santa Clara campus, the two

buildings are connected by a three-acre
park which is provided with shade by trellis

that houses 390 kW of solar panels. These
solar panels bring the total onsite solar

generation capacity at our headquarters
to 845 kW. In FY24, in support of our

renewable electricity goal, we also added
solar panels at our Hyderabad campus.

In FY25, we increased the amount of our

renewable electricity use to 100% for offices
and data centers under our operational control,

sourcing includes on-site renewables and
purchasing utility renewable electricity
tariffs, energy attribute certificates and
purchase power agreements. We are exploring
additional options to increase our sourcing of
renewable energy for our growing footprint.

We plan to continue our goal of

100%

renewable electricity use annually.

Waste Management

We aim to reduce the amount of waste we

send to landfill through waste reduction, reuse,
and recycling initiatives. We engaged a vendor

to complete a gap analysis of our Santa Clara
campus to better understand opportunities

to increase our landfill diversion rate and
minimize the amount of waste generated.

For products we use for testing, R&D, and
production purposes, we have programs in
place to support internal re-use of equipment
that hasn’t reached the end of its useful life
or financial depreciation life. We properly

sold to a vendor for refurbishment and reuse,
with a portion of the financial proceeds
donated to the NVIDIA Foundation. For used
equipment, we use a global specialist e-waste
recycling vendor. All our vendors follow strict
certification guidelines and procedures
to ensure proper tracking of the chain of
custody, decommissioning, data erasure, and
recycling of broken or unusable hardware.

Water Conservation

We use water in our direct operations
in cooling towers and for food service,
landscaping, and sanitation. We take steps to
use water efficiently, particularly in locations
that are vulnerable to drought conditions.
We also conduct an annual water risk
assessment for all NVIDIA facilities and data

centers, which helps us understand which
sites are located in water-stressed areas.

Our two LEED Gold certified buildings in Santa
Clara, CA, incorporate a range of water-efficient

measures. Through the installation of low-flow
bathroom fixtures and the use of recycled

water for toilet flushing, the buildings are
designed to achieve reductions in domestic
water demand and potable water use for
sewage conveyance when compared with
buildings of standard design. We use reclaimed

The three-acre park that connects the two
buildings is planted with drought-tolerant trees
and the greenery is irrigated by reclaimed water.

Outside of Santa Clara, our Hyderabad,
India, site has a water treatment
plant that reuses the site’s treated
wastewater for landscape irrigation.

We’re introducing closed-loop liquid cooling

scale, liquid-cooled system, built on the

systems across our data centers to reduce
water usage and improve cooling efficiency.
These systems circulate an engineered fluid—
typically a mixture of propylene glycol, water,
and corrosion inhibitors—within a sealed loop,
eliminating the need for evaporative cooling
and significantly reducing water consumption.
For example, the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-

NVIDIA Blackwell platform, offers exceptional
performance while balancing energy costs
and heat. It packs unprecedented compute
density into each server rack, delivering
30x higher throughput, 25x more energy
efficiency, and 300x more water efficiency
than traditional air-cooled architectures.

At our Santa Clara headquarters, our Voyager and Endeavor buildings are LEED Gold certified and connected by a three-acre park that’s irrigated with reclaimed water and shaded by a trellis that houses solar panels.

Responsible Sourcing

We define human rights as the fundamental
rights, freedoms, and standards of treatment
belonging to all humans. We seek to promote
human rights throughout our supply chain
and expect our suppliers to respect human
rights whenever they provide products or
services for us. For our efforts related to
human rights in our supply chain, see our
Human Rights section. NVIDIA’s supplier
selection process incorporates social and
environmental factors, including risk analysis
on topics such as RBA code alignment, product
compliance, and environmental initiatives.

We hold ourselves and our suppliers to the
highest standards of behavior, and only

engage suppliers that share our values.
We closely manage our supply chain to

deliver innovative products that satisfy
our customers’ expectations in a socially

and environmentally conscious manner.

Responsible Minerals

NVIDIA is committed to the responsible

sourcing of minerals. We support, contribute
to, and rely on industry-wide efforts to

validate the source of minerals used in our
products, aiming to ensure that they come
from socially responsible sources and don’t
contribute to human conflict. Our goal is
to use only conflict-free gold, tantalum,
tungsten, and tin (3TG) in our products and to
achieve 100% Responsible Minerals Assurance
Process-compliant 3TG processing facilities.

Cooperation and Development (OECD)
Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible
Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-
Affected and High-Risk Areas (CAHRA).
This provides detailed recommendations to
help companies respect human rights and
avoid contributing to conflict through their
mineral purchasing decisions and practices.

We evaluate smelter metrics and share
an annual update in our Conflict Minerals
Report. We’ve successfully removed non-
compliant 3TG smelters and refiners from
our supply chain to help us meet this goal.
During the reporting period, 100% of our
suppliers and component manufacturers
responded with the requested information.

We also collect non-3TG smelter data
for cobalt and mica from our strategic

suppliers and report the initial results to
customers. As the cobalt and mica programs

through the RBA’s Responsible Minerals
Initiative (RMI) mature, our goal is to only

source from conflict-free refiners.

Our Responsible Minerals Policy, sourcing

around the Organization for Economic

Our conflict minerals due diligence program
is designed to conform in all major respects
with the framework recommended by
the OECD. We’ve established a company
management program endorsed by our
Executive Vice President, Operations. We
identify and assess the risks in our supply
chain and have adopted a strategy and process

for responding to the risks we’ve identified.
As part of our diligence process, we review

smelter data published by the Responsible

the RMI, as well as with the smelters that
were audited by the London Bullion Market

Association, or LBMA, the Responsible
Jewelry Council, or RJC, and the Tungsten
Industry—Conflict Minerals Council, or TI-CMC.
These groups carry out independent third-

Product Environmental
Impact

To understand the greenhouse gas emissions
generated across our product lifecycle and

in manufacturing, we perform third-party
verified Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs)

and Product Carbon Footprints (PCFs)
aligned with ISO international standards.

In FY26, we published a PCF summary for
our NVIDIA HGX™ H100 GPU baseboard.
The PCF was developed in conformance
with the ISO 14067:2018 standard and was
verified by a third party. It is a cradle-to-gate
study including impacts from raw material

component manufacturing, and assembly.

We collaborate with our suppliers to collect
product-specific data for high-impact
components, improving data quality,
relevance, and precision. This approach
replaces generic industry average data
with precise, supplier-specific information,
enabling us to identify key decarbonization
levers within our supply chain. Looking
ahead, we intend to expand our LCA product
portfolio, enhance our LCA models with
more accurate and granular component
data for high-volume products, and further
integrate supplier-specific data to provide
a comprehensive and precise assessment
of our products’ environmental footprint.

Manufacturing

Emissions are generated at every stage of our

product lifecycle, including manufacturing
within our supply chain. Since 2014, we’ve

expected our key silicon manufacturing and
systems contract manufacturing suppliers to

report their annual energy and water usage,
waste, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,

and reduction goals and objectives through
the RBA Environmental Survey or CDP. We
also expect suppliers to have their GHG
emissions verified by a third party. We use

product manufacturing impact and allocate
carbon emissions to our customers.

We accomplished our goal to engage
manufacturing suppliers to effect supplier
adoption of science-based targets. In

material, work-in-progress, and finished
goods shipments to optimize transport
and logistics, which results in reduced fuel
use and less impact on the environment.

This includes consolidating shipping
volumes and weights and implementing a
multimodal distribution system. An area
of continued focus is to consolidate the
number of pickups and shipments.

We expect carriers to report shipment data
to support carbon emissions calculations
and have sustainability initiatives, which are
both covered in quarterly business reviews.

End-of-Life Management

NVIDIA-branded products are subject to

electronic waste disposal requirements in
our various global markets, and we take

seriously our extended responsibility for
these products. In key regions such as the

U.S. and Europe, we’ve established recycling
programs in partnership with reputable

third parties and provide information to
consumers about how to recycle our branded
products through labeling and our website.

We help our customers monetize the
residual value in their older NVIDIA DGX™
servers when refreshing to the latest
technology with the help of a remarketing
partner. Older-generation DGX systems
may be resold in the secondary market, and
systems that are not resold are typically
broken into components and recycled.

Product Quality and Safety

Safety is a principle that permeates our
engineering culture. We incorporate it into
every step of our product development
process, from design and production
to the end-user experience.

Our products undergo rigorous qualification
and testing to ensure compliance
with customer safety and reliability

standards. With these standards in
mind, we’ve established product safety

Our Code

Our code of conduct outlines our core values
and establishes the expectations we have
about how we conduct business. It guides our
actions in our professional relationships with
fellow employees, as well as our customers,
partners, competitors, vendors, government
regulators, shareholders, and the community
at large. Our code applies to all employees
board members, and we expect all third parties
we do business with, including consultants,
contractors, and other service providers,
to act in a manner consistent with it.

Our Code is translated into 13
different languages, which are

available on our website.

Ethics and Cybersecurity

We strive to achieve the highest standards
of ethical conduct in all our business dealings

and are committed to promoting a culture of
integrity. NVIDIA employees receive code of
conduct training upon hire and then every two
years thereafter. This training covers topics
like ethics, preventing workplace harassment,

and sustainability. Employees who have
frequent contact with customers, partners,
and suppliers (such as those in sales, finance,
and procurement) complete additional global
anti-bribery and anti-corruption training.

In addition to employee cybersecurity
trainings, our Santa Clara headquarters is
certified to ISO 27001. For more information
on our approach to cybersecurity, see pp. 32
of our 2025 Form 10-K filed with the SEC.

Trustworthy AI

We endeavor to deliver AI models that:

Comply with privacy and
data protection laws,

Perform safely and
as intended,

Communicate
transparently about
a model’s design and
limitations, and

Minimize unwanted
bias and give all groups
equal opportunity to

benefit from AI.

Our Trustworthy AI principles, which we share
with our employees, customers, and partners,

reflect our core values and code of conduct.

Scope and Governance

To build Trustworthy AI (TAI), we develop
practices, methodologies, and tools for
datasets, machine learning frameworks,

AI model development, and software

development and testing. We build tools and
processes that enable us, our customers
and partners, and the ecosystem to
build AI that’s safe and trustworthy.

Our TAI efforts are led by a head of AI &
Legal Ethics and supported by dedicated
product and risk teams. These teams are
structured to work cross-functionally
with product, product security, safety, and
infrastructure teams to ensure our AI aligns
to our principles. The teams also participate
in external AI safety standards development
efforts to contribute industry best practices.

Our global public policy team monitors
global regulations and relevant standards
to ensure that we maintain compliance. The

internal AI Ethics Committee advises on
generative AI development with members

of our engineering, business, and legal
organizations. In FY25, we introduced new

training opportunities including a monthly
webinar and special-TAI volunteer task forces

to educate teams on how TAI principles are
applied to product development and releases.

Standards and Frameworks

We look to global frameworks such as the
EU’s High-Level Expert group on Artificial
Intelligence and Singapore’s Model Artificial

guide our software development processes,
from concept to performance validation to
decommission. We participate in industry-
driven initiatives like ML Commons, as well as
standards bodies like the IEEE Organizational
Governance of Artificial Intelligence Working
Group. NVIDIA is also a member of the National
Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) AI Safety Institute Consortium and
the Content Authenticity Initiative, which
are focused on the development and use of
safe and trustworthy AI systems. In FY25,
NVIDIA joined the UK AI Security Institute
and published a paper on Frontier AI Risk.
This aligns with our commitments to the U.S.
Voluntary Commitments and our aim to uphold
state-of-the-art practices in trustworthy AI.

NVIDIA also helped launch the National
Artificial Intelligence Research Resource

in partnership with the National Science
Foundation, which aims to broaden

access to the tools needed to power
responsible AI discovery and innovation.

Model Risk Management

NVIDIA aims to reduce the risk of harm from
deployment of AI models or systems. Model
risk can come from many sources, including
training datasets, malicious attacks, or
failure to comply with laws and regulations.

process, and outlines the elements
of development, validation, audit, and
documentation to all employees working
on models. This approach provides internal
development teams with guidance to achieve
innovative and ethically consistent solutions.

NVIDIA is committed to providing open-
source tools for trustworthy AI model
development and integration. For example,
NeMo Guardrails acts as a safety layer on top
of language models to enforce predefined
rules and policies during inference, NVIDIA
NeMo™ Evaluator provides a microservice to
assess AI models across academic and custom
benchmarks, and Garak serves as an LLM
vulnerability scanner for evaluating model
vulnerabilities and informing red teaming

activities. The NeMo Guardrails framework
also offers an interface to run an internal red

teaming to evaluate guardrails configurations.

500+

NVIDIA models across all domains

meet the Model Card++ standard.

Model cards are documents that detail
how machine learning (ML) models work,
ensuring clear communication about how
NVIDIA technology was made and should
be used by developers working with our
AI models. Model cards detail information
about the ML model’s metadata, including
the datasets that it’s based on, performance
measures that it was trained on, and the
deep learning training methodology itself.

We’ve enhanced our model cards to make
them more understandable to consumers,
investors, and policy makers. Those
enhancements focused on improved
readability with clearer language, increased
detail around ethical considerations, and
greater accessibility. In FY25, we open-
sourced the Model Card++ template for

To evaluate the safety of our models, we
employ AEGIS, a high quality content safety
evaluation dataset, LLM-based content
safety classifier model, and evaluation
benchmark from NVIDIA. AEGIS is backed
by a broad content safety risk taxonomy
that covers 12 critical risks in human-LLM
interactions, such as content including hate/
identity hate, harassment, or violence.

Alongside content safety, it’s important
to assess generative models for security
weaknesses. Garak—Generative AI Red-

from the user. An input rail can reject the
input, stopping any additional processing,
or alter the input (e.g., to mask potentially
sensitive data, to rephrase).

 > Dialog rails influence how the LLM is

prompted. They operate on canonical form

be executed, if the LLM should be invoked
to generate the next step or a response,
or if a predefined response should be used
instead, etc.

 > Retrieval rails are guardrails applied to

A retrieval rail can reject a chunk, preventing
it from being used to prompt the LLM, or
alter the relevant chunks (e.g., to mask

Human Rights

The NCG Committee has oversight of
policies and practices in connection with
human rights and provides periodic updates
to the Board. At the management level,
our Sustainability Steering Committee is
responsible for reviewing and ensuring
the effectiveness of our human rights
program. Through this governance body
and related executive engagement,

deems reasonable and necessary to ensure
compliance with our Human Rights Policy.

We regularly assess human rights-related
risks and potential impacts, review our policies
and management processes, and seek input
from stakeholders on our approach. In FY25,
NVIDIA commissioned an independent firm to
conduct a human rights saliency assessment
of potential human rights impacts across our
value chain. The expert consulted internal
and external stakeholders and reviewed
international principles and norms to identify
human rights risks and opportunities salient
to NVIDIA’s business. Stakeholder groups
within the company then validated the results.

Human Rights Principles

We follow the laws of the countries in which we operate and endorse internationally
recognized principles, including:

 > United Nations Global Compact

 > International Covenant on Economic,

 > United Nations Guiding Principles

Social and Cultural Rights

 > Universal Declaration of Human Rights

 > Core Conventions of the International

 > International Covenant on Civil and

Political Rights

Labour Organization

 > ILO Declaration on Fundamental
Principles and Rights at Work

salient human rights risk areas for NVIDIA:
responsible minerals sourcing; working
conditions in the supply chain; clean, healthy,
sustainable environment; responsible product
development; and responsible product use.

We plan to use the results of the assessment
to guide the enhancement of NVIDIA’s
human rights policy and program. In
FY26, we’ll review and update our Human
Rights and Responsible Minerals policies.
The assessment will also support the
enhancement of our human rights program as
we continue to work to address salient risks,
building out programming, and diligence.

All NVIDIA employees are required to
complete training on our code, which

includes our commitment and guidelines to
respect human rights. Additionally, certain

employees take RBA e-Learning Academy
courses and are engaged in RBA workgroups

relevant to our supply chain operations.

Employees, suppliers, and other external
stakeholders can confidentially and

anonymously report a concern about human
rights using our Speak-Up line, which is
available in seven languages. Our investigations
team will promptly investigate human rights
allegations it becomes aware of through our
Speak Up line and present any findings to

the Compliance Committee that require the

and potential cases of labor and human

input of that committee. We do not tolerate
retaliation against anyone for making a
complaint in good faith, bringing a potential
violation to the attention of management, or
participating or assisting in an investigation.

NVIDIA has been a signatory of the UN
Global Compact since June 2022. We’re
also a member of the Responsible Labor
Initiative (RLI), the Public-Private Alliance for
Responsible Minerals Trade (PPA), and the
Responsible Minerals Initiative.

Upstream Human Rights

We take the issue of forced labor very
seriously and conduct regular audits to ensure
all workers in our supply chain are treated with
respect and dignity. We’re full members of
the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and

work with them and similar industry groups
to prevent and eliminate forced labor from

global supply chains. Through the RBA, we
also work with expert organizations, NGOs,

and academia to advance our program and
standards, and we support efforts at an

industry level to identify and remediate actual

rights abuse. Our supplier audits haven’t
identified incidents of forced Uyghur labor.

We expect our suppliers to maintain
progressive employment, health, safety,
and ethical practices that meet or exceed
applicable laws, the RBA Code of Conduct,
our Code of Conduct, and our Human Rights
Policy. We also encourage suppliers to use
the RBA Code of Conduct as a platform to go
above and beyond compliance. We participate
in RBA’s Responsible Labor Initiative (RLI)
and monitor our supply chain through VAP
audits, which cover freely chosen employment,
child labor, and freedom of association.

In FY25, we reviewed VAP audits on 48%
of our strategic suppliers, bringing total

audits in the past two years to 91%. If we
uncover findings during these audits, we

work directly with suppliers to implement any
corrective actions. Accordingly, we worked

with certain suppliers to track working
hours, to address and comply with policies

related to document retention, and to
address and comply with zero hiring fees.

Product Due Diligence

We believe AI will enhance human welfare and
respects human rights in numerous ways.

NVIDIA is accelerating the AI revolution by
creating platforms and computing tools

that help developers, researchers, and
data scientists innovate in these areas.

Our products are customizable and integrable

across workflows and platforms. When
we provide tools to help developers create
applications for specific industries, we focus

on advancing deployments that demonstrate
trustworthiness grounded in principles

that reflect our core values. For more on
our efforts in delivering safe and ethical AI

models, see our Trustworthy AI section.

When we create new products, platforms,
or services, we have an interdisciplinary

team to evaluate whether our offerings
could be used in conflict with our Human
Rights Policy and provide recommendations
to minimize misalignment.

Percentage of water withdrawn in regions with High or

Extremely High Baseline Water Stress

We analyze withdrawal from water-stressed areas as part of our annual water risk assessment using
the WRI Aqueduct tool. In WRI Aqueduct, we define water-stressed areas as high or extremely high
baseline water stress (greater or equal to 3). The WRI assessment resulted in 20% of our FY24 facilities
water withdrawals as located in water-stressed areas.

The discussion of topics included in this report and our other corporate responsibility disclosures
should not be read as implying that such topics are “material” in the context of the U.S. federal
securities laws, Delaware General Corporation Law, or any other regulatory framework, even
where we use words such as “material” or “materiality”. Our approach to sustainability disclosures
is informed by reporting frameworks, such as the GRI, that involve broader definitions of
materiality than used for purposes of our compliance with SEC disclosure obligations. As a result,
“materiality” for purposes of our sustainability reporting includes impacts on communities, the
environment, and stakeholders such as employees, customers, and suppliers, and the inclusion
of topics in our sustainability reporting, even when described as “material,” does not indicate
that such topics are material to the Company’s business, operations, or financial condition.
