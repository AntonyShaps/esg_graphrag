As a result of our clean and renewable energy procurement, we have reduced our emissions by 23.8 million metric tons (M MT) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) since 2021. Wind and solar projects supported by Meta over the last decade are adding more than 15 gigawatts (GW) of clean and renewable energy to grids globally. Additionally, we are embedding circularity principles across our operations and exploring technologies like low carbon fuels and construction materials to reduce our emissions.\n",
