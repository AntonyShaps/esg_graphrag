These exclusions are reflected for all reported years of our ambition-based emissions data. These exclusions collectively account for 25% of our 2019 scope 3 footprint, which is well within SBTi’s guidelines to exclude no more than 33% of base year scope 3 emissions.<sup>123</sup> To learn more about the methodology behind our GHG accounting and carbon reduction ambition, refer to the [Methodology](Methodology) section.\n",

      "**Scope 3 emissions**\n",
      "Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from other sources in our value chain. We calculate our scope 3 emissions using methodologies from the Scope 3 Technical Guidance for the following categories identified as relevant:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Category 1: Purchased goods and services\n",
      "*   Category 2: Capital goods\n",
      "*   Category 3: Fuel- and energy-related activities (not included in scope 1 or scope 2)\n",

      "*   Category 11: Use of sold products\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve determined that the remaining scope 3 categories were either not relevant or not applicable based on the Scope 3 Standard’s relevance criteria, which is described further in our 2025 (FY2024) Independent Accountants’ Review Report. The emissions associated with categories deemed not relevant are not significant to scope 3 emissions individually or in the aggregate.\n",
      "\n",
      "For each relevant scope 3 category, we report emissions according to their minimum boundaries listed by the Scope 3 Standard. For certain categories, we’ve also included activities which the Scope 3 Standard deems optional. None of the scope 3 categories have associated biogenic carbon dioxide emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2024, we stopped reporting a scope 3 (Other categories) metric—a previously aggregated total that included certain emissions from category 2 (Capital goods), category 11 (Use of sold products), and category 12 (End-of-life treatment of sold products). Instead, we now present all emissions from category 2 (Capital goods) and category 11 (Use of sold products) as an aggregated total for business confidentiality purposes. The emissions from category 11 (Use of sold products) are not a material component of total scope 3 emissions. We’ve determined that category 12 (End-of-life treatment of sold products) is not relevant based on the relevance criteria in the Scope 3 Standard, and is therefore no longer included in our inventory boundary.\n",
      "\n",
      "For each relevant scope 3 category, we provide the following details, as applicable: the minimum and optional activities included, calculation methods, activity data, emission factors, percentage of category emissions from value chain partners, allocations, and any significant estimates or assumptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**“Category 1: Purchased goods and services”** includes upstream emissions generated from manufacturing consumer devices and spare parts, our food program, and additional goods and services purchased for our operations. We use a combination of the average-data method and spend-based method, as defined by the Scope 3 Technical Guidance. To calculate supply chain emissions generated from manufacturing consumer devices and spare parts, we perform third-party-verified Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) in accordance with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14040 and ISO 14044. To calculate emissions generated from our food program, we use LCA emission factors from WRI’s Cool Food Pledge Calculator and annual procurement volumes from our San Francisco Bay Area offices. Where procurement volume data isn’t available for the remaining offices, we estimate remaining emissions by scaling the San Francisco Bay Area emissions based on global building admittance data. Where emission factors from WRI aren’t available, we estimate remaining emissions using spend data and the EPA’s U.S. Environmentally-Extended Input-Output (“USEEIO”) Supply Chain GHG Emission Factors (2024 v1.3), which are then adjusted for inflation using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index Inflation Calculator (“USEEIO supply chain emission factors”). To calculate emissions generated from the remaining goods and services purchased for our operations, we estimate supplier emissions using spend data and USEEIO supply chain emission factors. Approximately 2% of the data we use to calculate category 1 emissions are obtained from value chain partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "**“Category 2: Capital goods”** includes upstream emissions generated from final goods that are used in the manufacturing and assembly of servers and networking equipment used in our technical infrastructure, materials and fuels used in the construction of data centers and offices, and additional capital goods purchased for Alphabet’s operations. We use a combination of the average-data, and spend-based methods, as defined by the Scope 3 Technical Guidance, as well as LCAs that are in accordance with ISO 14040, ISO 14044, and ISO 14067. To calculate emissions generated from the manufacturing and assembly of servers and networking equipment used in our technical infrastructure, we transitioned in 2024 to primarily using LCAs as we continue to increase the accuracy of our estimates. This improved approach uses configurable LCA models (third-party reviewed) for high-impact components (which account for the majority of our total technical infrastructure hardware emissions). This allows us to tailor calculations to our specific mix of data center hardware and incorporate supplier-specific process-level data. For technical infrastructure components where LCA data is unavailable, we apply our previous spend-based method. For these remaining components, we collect supplier emissions data from our contract manufacturers as well as component and fables suppliers through the CDP Supply Chain Program. Alphabet’s share of these suppliers’ emissions is determined via economic allocation (i.e., based on revenue and spend). Where available and valid, we use scope 2 market-based method emissions from these suppliers. Where supplier-specific emissions data isn’t available through CDP, we estimate supplier emissions using spend data, USEEIO supply chain emission factors or proxy supplier emissions data. To calculate emissions generated from materials used in data center and office construction, we use data on annual construction area and lifecycle emission factors derived from LCAs conducted on our data centers and offices, as well as invoice-based material information. We input building mass by material data—either collected or estimated based on actual data when unknown—into LCA software (Tally, One Click LCA, and SimaPro—which reference emission factors from ecoinvent and Sphera) and the Embodied Carbon in Construction Calculator (EC3) webtool. For offices, the LCA results undergo third-party review (e.g., by the U.S. Green Building Council for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design [LEED] certification). To calculate emissions generated from additional capital goods purchased for our operations, we estimate supplier emissions using spend data and USEEIO supply chain emission factors. Approximately 15% of the data we use to calculate category 2 emissions are obtained from value chain partners.\n",
